<p><a href="http://theruntime.com/blogs/jaykimble/archive/2008/10/21/data-and-services-with-silverlight-2-review.aspx">Jay Kimble</a> is one of the technical reviewers of my book &ldquo;Data-Driven Services with Silverlight 2&rdquo;. He reviewed the book in its entirety and will be reviewing all of the code in VB and C#, too. <a href="http://theruntime.com/blogs/jaykimble/archive/2008/10/21/data-and-services-with-silverlight-2-review.aspx">He recently posted a quick review of his thoughts</a> after reading through the rough draft of my book on his web site. That&rsquo;s one happy customer &hellip; hopefully everyone will like it :)</p>

I appreciate the interest he showed &hellip; hopefully the book will live up to the expectations :)</p>
