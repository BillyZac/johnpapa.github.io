<p>I feel pretty awesome.</p>
<p>Some of this great feeling has to be from the better eating too. I cut out junk food and cut down my crap snacks to one a day or zero per day. So far the worst thing I eat is a yogurt or a cereal. So not bad. I&rsquo;m eating a lot of proteins now, which is a shift from my usual eating habits of lots of sugar and carbs. I love my carbs &hellip; pasta, steamed white rice, bread &hellip; oh I love those. The first month has you cut back on carbs big time and ramp up on proteins. Of course, overall the sugars are supposed to go down too. It&rsquo;s really not rocket science &hellip; the eating habits I am doing now are really pretty much in line with the caloric intake I had before, just&nbsp; instead of a 200 calorie junk food I eat 200 calories in fruits or a protein shake. I&rsquo;m not looking for weight loss, though it certainly would happen if I wasn&rsquo;t already trim.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s workout was the easiest so far &hellip; arms and shoulders. I bounced around between biceps and triceps and shoulders for the hours through a variety of about 15 exercises &hellip; twice each. Sounds worse than it is. They all went pretty well, still an intense workout and some were much harder than others, but I felt the burn with them all. It was a good feeling though. I did the bonus exercise round, which was another 3 sets (twice again).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then came the ab ripper X (every day 1, 3 and 5) &hellip; I did better this time than on day 1 but it really is intense. It is about 15 minutes of various ab exercises, many of which I felt intensely and had to pause during. I was proud that I was able to do darn close to all the reps but there were points I just laid on the floor in between and was hoping Tony Horton would take a break longer than 10 seconds. He didn&rsquo;t in this routine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s over now and I&rsquo;m feeling good. The recovery drink is nice right after the workout &hellip; especially in our new blender that actually mixes everything. Hard to believe we had a crappy blender for 15 years that never mixed anything well.</p>
<p>Colleen and I are on the same workouts for days 3-7 (she does the lean workout and I do the classic). So she had her first taste of the weights and the ab ripper today. The ab ripper beat her up too but I was so proud that she stuck with it.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is yoga, but tonight is a good night sleep.</p>
<p>Not sure if I will blog every day &hellip; but for now I enjoy writing it down as it motivates me and serves as a journal of how it went for me to look back on.</p>
<p>Some folks asked what kind of shape you have to be in to start. First, I won&rsquo;t try to tell anyone how to exercise &hellip; I&rsquo;m not qualified. But I was in pretty good shape having played soccer a lot and for the past 6 months doing cardio and light weights days a week. It&rsquo;s still intense as heck and working muscles I have not used well in a long time though. Much more rounded. To me, I think as long as a person is doing exercise of any kind, they should be proud. Something is always better than nothing. Doesn&rsquo;t matter what program it is &hellip; my key is to find something that keeps my interest. Goals are important too &hellip; mine are not to be huge. I really have no desire for that at all. My goal is to be more flexible, stronger, faster, and more agile.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll see how this goes.</p>
