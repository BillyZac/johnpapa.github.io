<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/charlie/default.aspx">Charlie Calvert</a> has posted <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/charlie/archive/2007/03/04/samples-update.aspx">some samples</a> intended for use with the March CTP of Orcas. These samples replace the samples that are linked from the MSDN docs in the CTP (which is good since I have had mixed result wth them so far). Charlie also <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/charlie/archive/2007/03/05/march-ctp-samples-overview-video.aspx">posted a video on the samples here</a> that helps explain them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
