In case you haven't heard, Durandal is currently running <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/eisenbergeffect/durandal-2014">a Kickstarter</a> to help fund their project in the 2014 year. <a href="http://durandaljs.com/">Durandal</a> is an open source JavaScript library for creating apps with elegant, clean code. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/eisenbergeffect/durandal-2014">Their Kickstarter</a> promises new releases, new and improved tooling, video training courses and a NextGen tech preview.</p>
<p>By backing the project, you not only help them to achieve their goals, but you can walk away with some nice goodies. For example, if you back at $15 you get the first video training course along with source code. That's a great followup to <a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/courses/TableOfContents?courseName=single-page-apps-jumpstart">my Pluralsight course on Durandal</a>. If you want to pledge more you can get the 2nd and 3rd training courses, early access to the sample app source, early access to tooling and next gen code, t-shirts, virtual conference training, marketing opportunities and more. There's great rewards for individuals, companies and community organizers...plus it helps the project to build a strong foundation for long-term business growth.</p>
<p>The training is an obvious perk of <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/eisenbergeffect/durandal-2014">this campaign</a>, especially since it's being produced by the creator of Durandal. 

<h3>NextGen Preview</h3>
If the Kickstarter is funded, a parallel implementation of Durandal will be produced. Stop what you are doing and <a href="https://vimeo.com/82601948">watch the &quot;hello world&quot; video now</a>. Wow. It's based on emerging web standards, is one of the simplest SPA dev experiences I've seen.</p>

It's an exciting time to be a developer and Durandal is offering some amazing opportunities. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/eisenbergeffect/durandal-2014">Are you willing to help out?</a> There's only a few days left.
