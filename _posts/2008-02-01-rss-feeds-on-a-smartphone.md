<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/12/default.aspx">December 2006 issue of MSDN Magazine</a>&nbsp;is now posted online. My latest <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/12/DataPoints/">Data Points</a> column discusses development with the SmartPhone (titled &quot;RSS Feeds on a Smartphone&quot;). Here is a excerpt from the article quoted from the introduction:</p><p>&nbsp;<em>This month I will demonstrate how to build a Windows Mobile<sup class="clsSmall">&reg;</sup> 5.0 application that reads RSS feeds and loads them into an ADO.NET DataSet. I will start out by showing how to request an RSS feed from a URL asynchronously and then demonstrate how to read the RSS feed and load it into a DataSet. Next, I will show you how to navigate the DataSet&#39;s hierarchy to find the appropriate data containing each feed&#39;s items. Then I will discuss how to use anonymous delegates to sort the data, how to check for the existence of a field in the RSS data using ADO.NET, and how to use the WebBrowser control to navigate to a URL or display HTML. Finally, I will demonstrate how to deploy the application to a mobile device using a CAB project. The full source code for this sample application is available from the MSDN<sup class="clsSmall">&reg;</sup>Magazine Web site.</em></p><p>You can read the article <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/12/DataPoints/">online here</a>. </p><p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/06/"></a></p><p><img border="0" height="345" src="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/images/covers/December06coverlg.gif" style="width: 263px; height: 345px" width="263" />&nbsp;</p>
