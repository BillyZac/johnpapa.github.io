Not only did you get the day of for “training”, but the “training” is actually something you’re very interested in.&#160; Maybe you haven’t had the chance yet, or you’re looking for additional guidance; but today you’re going on a tour of Silverlight 3, Expression Blend, SketchFlow, the Silverlight Toolkit, RIA Services and XAML Power toys.</p>    <ul>     <li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mithund/">Mithun Dhar</a> starts the day off with a <strong>welcome and logisitics</strong>.You notice his navy blazer, wondering if he’s warm or not. </li>      <li>The crowd cheers&#160; and waits expectantly for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/begley/3346862197/">disco moves</a> as <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/">Scott Guthrie</a> presents <strong>the keynote</strong>, explaining how Silverlight is awesome in so many ways. </li>      <li><a href="http://timheuer.com/blog/">Tim Heuer</a> enters next with a smile on his face and <strong>a load of scenarios where Silverlight</strong> is a smart choice. As he mentions your specific scenario, you’re convinced training was a good idea today. </li>      <li><strong>Break time</strong> – you run to the bathroom, too much coffee this morning. </li>      <li><a href="http://adamkinney.com">Adam Kinney</a> welcomes you back from the break, actually you specifically as you were the last one back in. You begin to blush but Adam dives into <strong>Expression Blend</strong>. You can tell he enjoys the tool and the joy starts to spread among the audience. </li>      <li><strong>Lunch!</strong> – free food! free drinks! cool.&#160; You find the one or two people you know there and find a place to sit down. Conversation ranges from the weather to Silverlight to something caught in between your teeth. </li>      <li>After lunch and returning to your seat, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/janete/default.aspx">Janete Perez</a> keeps you from taking your after-lunch nap by <strong>building prototypes in SketchFlow</strong> very quickly.&#160; You’re intrigued. </li>      <li><a href="http://silverlight.net/blogs/JustinAngel/">Justin Angel</a> and <a href="http://blog.enginefour.com/">Shawn Oster</a> take the stage.&#160; You’re distracted by the fact Justin is wearing sunglasses inside, but your reverie is broken when they begin racing through all of the available <strong>Silverlight Controls</strong>. What a full framework. </li>      <li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/">Brad “no microphone needed” Abrams</a> takes the stage and shows you the <strong>RIA Services</strong> framework. First the multitude of controls and now line of business application building blocks out the wazoo.&#160; You’re set and can’t wait to try this when you get home. Or maybe just tomorrow morning at work. </li>      <li><strong>Break time</strong> – 52 different types of free drinks are available in the sliding door refrigerator.&#160; You counted. </li>      <li>One of the first ones to return to your seat this time, <a href="http://karlshifflett.wordpress.com/">Karl Shifflett</a> shows off <strong>XAML Power Toys</strong>. You know this is cool stuff, you’ll want to look at again, but you are completely lost in the palm trees on Karl’s Hawaiian shirt. </li>      <li>All of the speakers come back to the stage for a <strong>Q &amp; A Panel</strong>. Discussion is lively and casual, you’re happy to be here in person. </li>      <li>The conference officially ends, and you find your favorite speakers and listen to them answer a few questions from the circle around them. </li>      <li>Ready for dinner and some Silverlight time you head out and twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/TrueHarlequin/status/3251987674">FINALLY building something in Silverlight 3....mwa ha haaa...</a></li>   </ul> ”</blockquote>
