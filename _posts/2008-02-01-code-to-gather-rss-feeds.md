<P mce_keep="true">I recently wrote an article for <A class="" href="http://www.simple-talk.com/" mce_href="http://www.simple-talk.com">SimpleTalk.com</A> titled <A class="" href="http://www.simple-talk.com/dotnet/.net-tools/gathering-rss-feeds-using-visual-studio-and-rss.net/" mce_href="http://www.simple-talk.com/dotnet/.net-tools/gathering-rss-feeds-using-visual-studio-and-rss.net/">Gathering RSS Feeds Using Visual Studio and RSS.NET</A>. The article is now online and available to read. Here is the abstract for this article:</P> <BLOCKQUOTE> <P mce_keep="true">Integrating RSS feeds into applications has become very popular. There are several tools (such as Microsoft Outlook 2007) available to read blogs and news from RSS feeds. There are also some tools available (such as RSS.NET and the ASP.NET team's RSS Toolkit) that can aid you in the development of customizing feeds in your applications. This article will use the RSS.NET assembly, which can be freely downloaded and used from <A href="http://www.rssdotnet.com/">http://www.rssdotnet.com/</A>.</P></BLOCKQUOTE> <P mce_keep="true">For those who are not familiar with SimpleTalk, it is a web site that publishes articles on various technology topics. The site is operated by <A class="" href="http://www.red-gate.com/" mce_href="http://www.red-gate.com/">Red Gate Software</A>, which has some popular database tools that many of us use.</P>
