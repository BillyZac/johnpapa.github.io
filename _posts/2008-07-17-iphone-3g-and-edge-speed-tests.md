<p>Just ran several tests on EDGe and 3G with my iPhone 3G. Overall the speeds from EDGE were as expected … slow. The average speed after 5 tests on 3 different speed test sites using EDGE was 111kbps. The average speed on 3G after 5 tests on 3 different sites was 390kbps. That’s a pretty substantial improvement. I have heard that you can expect about 2.5x from EDGE to 3G. My small sample set shows more than 3.5x improvement.</p>  <p>Again, its a sample test of EDGE to 3G and there are other factors here, like my specific location of my test, others on the network, and so on. Also, i believe that y area just went live on 3G a few days ago, just after the iPhone 3G launch. This may mean that very few people even know 3G is here. Who knows for sure.</p><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/kick/?url=/all/iphone-3g-and-edge-speed-tests/"><img src="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/Services/Images/KickItImageGenerator.ashx?url=/all/iphone-3g-and-edge-speed-tests/&amp;bgcolor=0080C0&amp;fgcolor=FFFFFF&amp;border=000000&amp;cbgcolor=D4E1ED&amp;cfgcolor=000000" border="0/"></a></div><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_url = '/all/iphone-3g-and-edge-speed-tests/';</script><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_title = 'iPhone 3G and EDGE Speed Tests';</script><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_blurb = 'iPhone 3G and EDGE Speed Tests';</script><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_style = '1';</script><script language="javascript" src="http://widgets.dzone.com/widgets/zoneit.js"></script> </div>
