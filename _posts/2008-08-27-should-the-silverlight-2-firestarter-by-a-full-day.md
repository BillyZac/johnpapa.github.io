<p>Joe Healy and I have been coordinating a <a href="http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032387218&amp;culture=en-US">Silverlight 2 Firestarter event</a>. I posted the <a href="/all/silverlight-2-firestarter/">details of this event yesterday on my site</a>. the agenda is a 3 hour morning to lunch presentation/demonstration/discussion on Silverlight 2 with data, REST, services, and so on. We received some feedback that it might be good to have a full day Firestarter event where the morning lays the groundwork for Silverlight 2 (everything you need to know to get started) and the afternoon is the more advanced stuff (my original content). We are flexible and likely weâ€™ll do the whole day if that is what everyone wants.</p>  <p>So the question is: would this be beneficial to have a full day like this? Or is a full day too much? Please chime in.</p><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/kick/?url=/all/should-the-silverlight-2-firestarter-by-a-full-day/"><img src="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/Services/Images/KickItImageGenerator.ashx?url=/all/should-the-silverlight-2-firestarter-by-a-full-day/&amp;bgcolor=0080C0&amp;fgcolor=FFFFFF&amp;border=000000&amp;cbgcolor=D4E1ED&amp;cfgcolor=000000" alt="DotNetKicks Image" border="0/"></a></div><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><script type="text/javascript"><!-- var dzone_url = '/all/should-the-silverlight-2-firestarter-by-a-full-day/'; var dzone_title = 'Should the Silverlight 2 Firestarter By a Full Day?'; var dzone_blurb = 'Should the Silverlight 2 Firestarter By a Full Day?'; var dzone_style = '1'; --></script><script language="javascript" src="http://widgets.dzone.com/widgets/zoneit.js"></script> </div>
