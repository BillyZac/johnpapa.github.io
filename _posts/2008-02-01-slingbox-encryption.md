<p>I bought a Slingbox recently and have been using it just about everywhere I could to test it out. I&rsquo;ll be posting a review on it soon (stay tuned) but something stuck out at me this weekend. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/07/22/slingbox-encryption-upgrade-limits-functionality/">I read that Sling Media has announced that they will now encrypt their transmission of the data from the Slingbox</a>. You can <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/07/22/slingbox-encryption-upgrade-limits-functionality/">read the article here</a> on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget </a>&hellip; but it sounds like they are doing it to help appease the broadcasters, who have never been thrilled with the idea of placeshifting. </p> <p>If this is correct, one side effect of this is that <a href="http://www.applian.com/">Applian&rsquo;s&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.applian.com/at-large-recorder/index.php">At-Large Recorder</a> (formerly known as Replay SlingCorder), which records media from a SlingBox to a&nbsp;Windows media file (.asf or .wmv) &nbsp;file may no longer function properly due to this encryption. This product is on my list of products to review, but it appears that&nbsp;At-Large Recorder&nbsp;may have hit a major hurdle with Sling Media&rsquo;s encryption. Applian even put a posting on their web site stating the following &hellip;</p> <blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"> <p><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="2">Important News (7/13/06): SlingBox&trade; firmware v1.0.86, currently in beta, will not work with At-Large Recorder due to Sling's decision to add encryption to the stream. Make sure to use firmware v1.0.80 instead.</font></strong></p></blockquote> <p>All of this is according to what I read in news articles and from the <a href="http://www.applian.com/at-large-recorder/index.php">Applian web site</a>, so I do not claim to know the definitive facts on this issue. However, if you are looking at getting the Replay SlingCorder, i highly recommend doing your own research first with <a href="http://www.applian.com/">Applian</a>.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
