<p>I just unsubscribed from a bunch of email services I somehow got hooked into. When I clicked on the unsubscribe link for one of them, it opens a browser and shows me this awesome message:</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <blockquote>   <p>You have chosen to disable new book notifications. You will receive an email confirmation shortly.</p> </blockquote>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>I don’t want any more emails …. so they will send me an email to confirm that. lol</p>  <p><img height="1" alt="" src="http://microsofteref.books24x7.com/images/_.gif" width="20" border="0" /></p>
