<p mce_keep="true">I am evaluating different laptop/tablet PC options that I will use for development, taking notes, and presenting technical content. I have zeroed in on the ThinkPad X61 tablet PC but as many of you know in our businsss we tend to require more power than most people in our equipment. I have also evaluated the Fujitsu Lifebook T4220 which seems to have a better CPU and screen, but lacks the 7200 RPM drive. So the reviews I have read have not really answered my question of how well this computer will perform for presentations hitting Virtual PC instances or for developing with Visual Studio.NET and SQL Server, for example. If any of you have any experience or have researched this, please let me know your thoughts. In return, I promise to give a detailed review of my experience with whatever purchase I end up with.</p>
