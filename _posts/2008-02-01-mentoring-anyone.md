<P mce_keep="true">Recently I have had an increase in interest in the mentoring services and architectural design services that I offer. I think the reason for this is that software development is changing so rapidly now that many shops that have been coding as fast as they can (some with the bleeding edge technologies) have at times lost sight of building a solid architecture. Solid practices are crucial to the long term success of a software product now perhaps more than ever. </P> <P mce_keep="true">I have seen many applications of late using the coolest and latest that our industry has to offer. Yet many of these apps was built without much thought for performance, extensibility, scalability, nor maintainability. Perhaps this is one reason why there has been an increase in the mentoring demand. Perhaps its all just chance. </P>
