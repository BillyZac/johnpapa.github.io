<p></p>  <p>I’ve loved my iPhone so far. It has some awesome features, keeps me connected to work, allows me to not carry an iPod and a phone, and the AppStore is killer. But there are some well documented issues from many users. The battery life is horrific. I cannot get through half a day of normal without having to charge it. Apple’s solution … turn off WiFi, location services, bluetooth and 3G.&#160; Um, OK. That’s like buying a Ferrari and going 10MPH in it to save gas. Come on Apple, get serious!</p>  <div>So <a href="http://computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9114398">Jobs comes out and says that with the 2.1 update</a> that was released today that it promises to fix a lot of bugs and address some big concerns such as:</div>  <ul>   <li>improved battery life </li>    <li>fewer call drops </li>    <li>less crashes </li>    <li>less time to synch with iTunes </li> </ul>  <p>These are the 4 biggest problems I have noticed so far. I would put them in the order I listed them above, too. Battery life is just horrible. A mobile device has to get through a day’s use. And for someone who uses the mobile device a lot, especially when traveling I am lost without a mobile device. Sometimes its just not practical to whip out the laptop. I can get through a day if I do nothing on the phone but check email every 30 minutes. That’s just silly.</p>  <p>Call drops … you know, if they can limit them, that’s great! But I don’t know if I believe they can do this. Most call drops I chalk up to poor reception in my area as it toggles between EVDO and 3G with 0 bars to 5 bars. </p>  <p>My iPhone does not crash often, probably once a week. But my first iPhone crashed several times in the week I had it. I returned it for this reason (and so I could get the 16gb device). But my wife and father both have an iPhone and they experience more crashes than I do. So less crashes is a good thing we are looking forward to.</p>  <p>Time to synch with iTunes … its a hassle for sure, but I don’t really mind it too much most of the time. I just let it run in the background. The backups can be very long … a few of them took about an hour for my phone, probably due to all the music and videos on it. So if that can be decreased, then that’s good.</p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p>So I just updated to 2.1 while I wrote this post. It took under 10 minutes from start to finish. I’ll post more on the results of these promises from Apple as I test it out this weekend. But man, I am looking forward to the possibility that Apple may deliver this time. &lt;crossingfingers/&gt;</p><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/kick/?url=/all/iphone-2-1-update-ndash-big-promises/"><img src="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/Services/Images/KickItImageGenerator.ashx?url=/all/iphone-2-1-update-ndash-big-promises/&amp;bgcolor=0080C0&amp;fgcolor=FFFFFF&amp;border=000000&amp;cbgcolor=D4E1ED&amp;cfgcolor=000000" alt="DotNetKicks Image" border="0/"></a></div><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_url = '/all/iphone-2-1-update-ndash-big-promises/'; var dzone_title = 'iPhone 2.1 Update – Big Promises'; var dzone_blurb = 'iPhone 2.1 Update – Big Promises'; var dzone_style = '2';</script><script language="javascript" src="http://widgets.dzone.com/widgets/zoneit.js"></script> </div>
