<P>I've been doing some research on my next ADO.NET v2 book project so I've been reading several different ADO.NET v1 books trying to get a feel for what they did well, not so well, etc. I've read up a lot of reviews on these books which has helped me ge t feel for which ones did well. But I thought I would open the floor and ask ya'll what you look for in a book. What makes you take it off the shelf and, <STRONG>more importantly</STRONG>, read it end to end. Feel free to give your constructive opinions on what some of the existing ADO.NET v1 books out there did well and not so well, I know Sahil and I are both writing about ADO.NET and would love to hear some comments from ya'll. Thanks ahead of time!</P>
