<p>I started a <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/msdn/showpost.aspx?postid=3391412&amp;siteid=1&amp;sb=0&amp;d=1&amp;at=7&amp;ft=11&amp;tf=0&amp;pageid=0">"wish list" post in the ADO.NET Entity Framework forums</a> last week. I fed it with a few items to get things going and it has taken off with great input from several people. If you have anything you would like to add to your wish list for features in the next release, please jump in and add your 2 cents.</p> <p>There have been some great ideas including some of the obvious ones like adding POCO support. improved designer support, and more of an entity model first approach (where we can create entities and have it generate the database from it). But there are also some awesome ideas I never thought of in the list. <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/msdn/showpost.aspx?postid=3391412&amp;siteid=1&amp;sb=0&amp;d=1&amp;at=7&amp;ft=11&amp;tf=0&amp;pageid=0">Check it out</a> and your input. </p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:B3E14793-948F-49af-A347-D19C374A7C4F:261e155f-9b76-498d-a8ef-3425bd07eab3" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"> <script type="text/javascript"><!--
