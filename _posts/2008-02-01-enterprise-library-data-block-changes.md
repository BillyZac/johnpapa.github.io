<P>If you have not checked out the latest build of Ent Lib, you can get the Enterprise Library – June 2005 release <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=A7D2A109-660E-444E-945A-6B32AF1581B3&amp;displaylang=en">here</A>. The <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/june2005release.asp">list of changes </A>can be found <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/june2005release.asp">here</A>, as well. Borrowing from their master list, the list of changes to the Data Access Application Blocks are as follows:</P> <UL> <LI>The new method named <B>GetStoredProcCommandWrapperWithSourceColumns</B> is added to the <B>Database </B>class. This method provides creation of a stored procedure command wrapper whose parameter values come from source columns in a <B>DataTable</B>. In addition, new public methods provide access to the <B>DbDataAdapter</B> object for the current database connection. <LI>The <B>DataConnectionFailedEvent </B>and <B>DataConnectionOpenedEvent </B>classes are updated to be thread safe. <LI>The <B>OracleCommandWrapper</B> class is updated to perform proper conversion between parameters of types not recognized by Oracle and native Oracle types. </LI></UL> <P>If you haven’t jumped into the Ent Lib yet, its worth a good look. The code is open so you can build on what you don’t like or leave it as is. You can also use some blocks and ignore others (as I do). I am looking forward to the next version (v 2.0). If you are too, check out <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tomholl/">Tom Hollander’s blog </A>occasionally as well. He often has good posts on Ent Lib. If you are looking to jump in, you can take a look at <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/07/DataPoints/default.aspx">Part 1</A> and <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/08/DataPoints/default.aspx">Part 2</A> of my 3 part series on the Data Access Applicaiton Block online at <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag">MSDN Magazine</A>. </P> <P>I’ve received a lot of good feedback on these articles with a lot of good questions and what if scenarios. Unfortunately, IU have not been able to keep up with the number of responses I have received so please don’t think I am ignoring you if I don’t get back right away. I do read all of my email and I appreciate all of your input, so please keep it coming and I will try to respond as much as I can.</P>
