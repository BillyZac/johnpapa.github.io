<P>I am happy to announce that I am joining <A href="http://www.aspsoft.com/">ASPSOFT</A> (aka the haven of the <A href="http://www.angrycoder.com/">angrycoder</A>, <A href="http://aspsoft.blogs.com/">Jonathon Goodyear</A>). I ran across Jonathon somewhat by accident when I was exploring the job market in southwest Florida, we started talking and after a few weeks I was on board with <A href="http://www.aspsoft.com/">ASPSOFT</A>. (It's funny that Jonathon and I have never actually met before since we often present at the same conferences.)</P> <P><A href="http://www.aspsoft.com/"><IMG style="BORDER-TOP-STYLE: none; BORDER-RIGHT-STYLE: none; BORDER-LEFT-STYLE: none; TEXT-ALIGN: center; BORDER-BOTTOM-STYLE: none" src="/photos/jpapa/images/62032/original.aspx" align=middle border=0></A> <P></P> <P>A special thanks to <A href="/blogs/david.hayden/">David Hayden</A>, <A href="http://dotnettemplar.net/">J. Ambrose Little</A> and everyone else who had the patience and the kindness to help me in my search. And of course, thanks to Jonathon for asking me to be a part of his team.</P> <P>I look forward to starting in May and working with Jonathon, Ambrose and the <A href="http://www.aspsoft.com/">ASPSOFT</A> crew. Of course I'll still be blogging here with the crew of <A href="/blogs">codebetter.com</A> and writing for <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag">MSDN Magazine</A> and other publications. </P> <P>&nbsp;</P>
