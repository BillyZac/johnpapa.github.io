<P>I’ve been using <A href="http://blogjet.com/">BlogJet</A> for a few weeks now to post to my blog and while it has not overwhelmed me, it has proven to be a useful tool. Here are some quick observations that I have made regarding the pros and cons that are important to me:</P> <P>Pros:</P> <UL> <LI>It is nice to be able to post to my blog without having to go to my blog’s web page <LI>I can save drafts of my postings locally or post them as non published to my blog <LI>Basic formatting such as bullets, hyper links, fonts and images are easy <LI>Associating my post with 1 or more categories from my blog is easy <LI>I can date my blogs in the future for a future release <LI>It has spell check (disabled by default)</LI></UL> <P>Cons:</P> <UL> <LI>Setting it up was not as easy as I would have hoped since I had to figure out what Provider to select and what web page to point it to for Community Server. (Thankfully, other <A href="/blogs/">codebetter.com</A> crewmen had already been down that road.) <LI>If it had built in code formatting for code samples, well, that would be awesome. (Currently I use a custom program I wrote as well as a program called <A href="http://www.jtleigh.com/CopySourceAsHtml/">CopySourceAsHtml</A>&nbsp;for formatting code.)</LI></UL> <P>I don’t have any serious complaints with <A href="http://blogjet.com/">BlogJet</A> so I will continue using it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P> <P><A HREF="/blogs/eric.wise">Eric Wise</A>&nbsp;did a <A HREF="/blogs/eric.wise/archive/2005/04/03/61152.aspx">quick review of BlogJet</A> a few weeks ago, as well.</P>
