<p>Last week I posted my swivel behavior on my web site and today I uploaded it to the Expression Gallery. If you are working on Silverlight and are not aware of the Expression Gallery, you need to check it out. There are some great community contributions up there â€¦ and then there is my behavior. :-)</p>  <p>You can read the <a href="/silverlight/swivel-behavior-in-silverlight-3/">full post on how the behavior works right here</a> , or <a href="/silverlight/adding-a-rotating-button-to-the-swivel-behavior-demo/">read the updated post here</a> that adds some additional features outside of the behavior, or you can check out the behavior in action in <a href="http://gallery.expression.microsoft.com/en-us/SwivelBehavior">Expression Gallery right here.</a></p>
