<P>If you haven't seen this yet, <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/?url=/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/EntLib2.asp">Enterprise Library for .NET 2 has been released this month</A>. <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=5A14E870-406B-4F2A-B723-97BA84AE80B5&amp;displaylang=en">Ent Lib 2's download is available</A> as well as some webcasts and PowerPoint presentations that go through the features. Looks like the hands on labs will be coming soon.&nbsp; Even if you never checked out Ent Lib 1.1 for .NET 1.1 you should spend some time looking at the new version for .NET 2. It comes with a series of application blocks that can jump start your application's development. Of course my favorite is the Data Access Application Block but I am also a fan of the Crypto Block, too. :-)&nbsp; I'll be putting an article together for MSDN Mag that should appear later this year on the Data Access App Block in Ent Lib 2, as well.</P> <P><IMG alt="Ent Lib 2" src="/photos/jpapa/images/137131/original.aspx" border=0> </P> <P>This is taken from the Patterns and Practices web site:</P> <BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"> <P><SPAN style="COLOR: #000000"><EM>Enterprise Library, the collection of reusable and extensible application blocks for enterprise development, has been improved and updated specifically for Visual Studio 2005 and the .NET Framework 2.0 (January 2006)</EM></SPAN></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
