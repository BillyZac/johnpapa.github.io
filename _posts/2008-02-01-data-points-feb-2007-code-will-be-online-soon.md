<div class="Section1"><p class="MsoNormal">The code that can be downloaded from the MSDN Magazine web site for my<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/07/02/DataPoints/default.aspx"> February 2007 Data Points article</a> is not correct. Several people have noticed this and graciously let me know about the problem. I have since sent the correct code to the MSDN Magazine crew and they assure me the correct code will be made available in the download from their site as soon as possible. I apologize for the inconvenience.<span style="font-size: 10pt; color: navy; font-family: 'Tahoma','sans-serif'"></span></p><br /><br /><p class="MsoNormal">UPDATE: For some reason, when I post the ZIP file to the codebetter site, it gets corrupted. So instead, here is a <a href="http://www.7papa7.com/dloads/MSDN%202007%2002%20Code.zip">link where you can download the code.zip file</a>.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p></div>
