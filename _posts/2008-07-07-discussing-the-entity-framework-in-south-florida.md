Its always great to see family.</p>  <p>Anyway … the session abstract is as follows …</p>  <p>Making the most of the Entity Framework involves first designing a practical Entity Data Model, understanding how to manage the model, and how to effectively interact with it through services. In this presentation I will give a brief overview of the Entity Framework and its related components, demonstrate how to design and manage an Entity Data Model using the designer tools, and walk through examples of how to interact with the model and use tools such as the standard query operators. Demonstrations will include Entity SQL with the Entity Client provider, Entity SQL with Object Services, and LINQ. </p>  <p>This is an INETA sponsored meeting and food will be provided.</p><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/kick/?url=/all/discussing-the-entity-framework-in-south-florida/"><img src="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/Services/Images/KickItImageGenerator.ashx?url=/all/discussing-the-entity-framework-in-south-florida/&amp;bgcolor=0080C0&amp;fgcolor=FFFFFF&amp;border=000000&amp;cbgcolor=D4E1ED&amp;cfgcolor=000000" border="0/"></a></div><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_url = '/all/discussing-the-entity-framework-in-south-florida/';</script><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_title = 'Discussing the Entity Framework in South Florida';</script><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_blurb = 'Discussing the Entity Framework in South Florida';</script><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_style = '1';</script><script language="javascript" src="http://widgets.dzone.com/widgets/zoneit.js"></script> </div>
