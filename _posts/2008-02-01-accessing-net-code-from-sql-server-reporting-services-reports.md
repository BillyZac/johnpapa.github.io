<P>The&nbsp;<A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/07/default.aspx">July 2007 issue of MSDN Magazine</A>&nbsp;is now posted online. My latest <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/07/DataPoints/">Data Points</A> column discusses how to create charts, embedded code, and access existing .NET class libraries from SQL Server Reporting Services 2005â€™s reports.</P> <P>You can read the article <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/07/DataPoints/">online here</A>. </P> <P><A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/06/"></A></P> <P><IMG alt="" src="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/images/covers/July06coverlg.gif" border=0>&nbsp;</P> <P>&nbsp;</P> <P>Its been a busy year for me with family and work. So I am taking a short break from writing but will be back in the October 2006 issue of MSDN Magazine with my Data Points column that discusses System.Transactions in .NET 2. It will build upon <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/02/DataPoints/">my earlier article on this topic about 2 years ago </A>(during the beta phase of .NET when it was still called Whidbey and SQL Server was Yukon).</P> <P>&nbsp;</P>
