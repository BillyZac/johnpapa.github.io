<P>In the&nbsp;<A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/10/default.aspx">October 2005 issue of MSDN Magazine</A>&nbsp;I continued my discussion of the Enterprise Libraryâ€™s Data Access Application Block. This is the final episode in the trilogy where I explore the Enterprise Library DAAB <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/07/DataPoints/default.aspx">in my Data Points column</A>.&nbsp;I had a lot of&nbsp;good feedback from&nbsp;parts 1 and 2.&nbsp;OK, so I generally don't like write 3 part articles, but I just kept&nbsp;running out of room (after all, magazines have space limitations).&nbsp;There is just so much to say about the Ent Lib DAAB :-)</P> <P>You can read the article <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/10/DataPoints/default.aspx">online here</A>. Or you can read the whole series of the Ent Lib DAAB discussion at these links:</P> <UL> <LI><A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/07/DataPoints/">The Enterprise Library Data Access Application Block, Part 1</A> <LI><A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/08/DataPoints/">The Enterprise Library Data Access Application Block, Part 2</A> <LI><A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/10/DataPoints/">The Enterprise Library Data Access Application Block, Part 3</A></LI></UL> <P><A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/10/default.aspx"><IMG src="/photos/jpapa/images/131961/original.aspx" border=0></A></P> <P>&nbsp;</P> <P>In the upcoming issues I'll be getting into ADO.NET 2 and some of its features. I've also been toying with a follow up article on system.transactions since so much has changed and I have had so many good comments and questions on the topic. </P>
