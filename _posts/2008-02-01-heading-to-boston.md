Just confirmed that I'll be at <A href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2005/bo/">VSLive in Boston </A>this June. If you plan on attending VSLive, drop by. I'll be presenting 2 topics: <BR><BR><B>Get Ready for ADO.NET 2 (5:45 pm to 6:45 pm, Wednesday, June 29, 2005)</B> <BR>Data access using ADO.NET is at the core of most .NET enterprise applications. While ADO.NET 1.x is powerful, its successor ADO.NET 2 contains several new features that are can benefit an application. I'll review these new features and how to take advantage of them including binary serialization of DataSets,&nbsp;new features and objects built into the DataSet&nbsp;and enhancements to strongly typed DataSets. <BR><BR><B>Lightweight Promotable Transactions using System Transactions and ADO.NET 2 (2:00 pm to 3:00 pm, Thursday, June 30)</B> <BR>The.NET Framework v2 includes the System.Transactions namespace that enhances transactional support for managed code. I’ll discuss how System.Transactions can handle transactions without using other common practices such as deriving from a ServicedComponent, using interception, or using reflection. Designed to integrate with SQL Server 2005, System.Transactions supports the intelligent and automatic promotion of local lightweight transactions to fully distributed transactions. It also introduces a new class called LightweightTransactionManager, which is a faster alternative to using the DTC for local transactions. I will walk through examples that modify the default transactional settings of the implicit local transaction and modify the isolation level, timeout period and transaction’s context. I will demonstrate how and when the System.Transactions namespace delegates the promotion of a lightweight transaction to a fully distributed transaction. I will also discuss how to develop explicit transactions and manually choose when and if to enlist in a transaction context. <BR><BR><A href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2005/bo/"><IMG src="/photos/jpapa/images/60702/original.aspx" border=0></A>
