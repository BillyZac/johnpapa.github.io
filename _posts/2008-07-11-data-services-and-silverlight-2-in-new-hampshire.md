<p>I just confirmed that on Thursday July 24th I will be in Nashua, NH for an INETA sponsored user group meeting with the <a href="http://www.nhdn.com">New Hampshire .NET User Group</a>. I’ll be up in Albany a few days before that at the <a href="http://www.TVUG.net">www.TVUG.net</a>&#160; user group, so I’ll be doing a bit of driving around the New England and NY states. I may be speaking at another user group in the area then too, but it is not confirmed yet. This session in NH is titled Data Services with Silverlight 2 and here are just a few items I will be demonstrating:</p>  <ul>   <li>Silverlight data binding </li>    <li>Using WCF with Silverlight </li>    <li>Parsing XML with LINQ to XML </li>    <li>Using REST services from Silverlight </li> </ul>  <p></p>  <p>I have a lot of material to go through so I need to cut it down to the 1.5 to 2 hour time frame for the meeting. This topic is near and dear to me and it coincides well with my upcoming book with O’Reilly titled Data Services with Silverlight 2 due out in December 2008.</p>  <p>If you are in the Nashua NH area on Thursday July 24th, please stop by and check things out. You can find out more on their web site at <a href="http://www.nhdn.com">www.nhdn.com</a>&#160; </p>  <p>Here is the abstract for the session …</p>  <p>Silverlight enables developers to use their .NET and XAML skills to develop Rich Internet Applications and to build data driven Silverlight applications that communicate with multi-tier architectures. This session will show how to build Silverlight 2 applications that communicate with and consume REST services and use LINQ to XML to manage XML content, show the various data binding techniques, and show how to use WCF to talk to various middle tier services including custom entity models and the Entity Framework.</p><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/kick/?url=/all/data-services-and-silverlight-2-in-new-hampshire/"><img src="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/Services/Images/KickItImageGenerator.ashx?url=/all/data-services-and-silverlight-2-in-new-hampshire/&amp;bgcolor=0080C0&amp;fgcolor=FFFFFF&amp;border=000000&amp;cbgcolor=D4E1ED&amp;cfgcolor=000000" border="0/"></a></div><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_url = '/all/data-services-and-silverlight-2-in-new-hampshire/';</script><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_title = 'Data Services and Silverlight 2 in New Hampshire';</script><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_blurb = 'Data Services and Silverlight 2 in New Hampshire';</script><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_style = '1';</script><script language="javascript" src="http://widgets.dzone.com/widgets/zoneit.js"></script> </div>
