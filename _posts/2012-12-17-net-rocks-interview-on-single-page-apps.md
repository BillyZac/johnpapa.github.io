The .NET Rocks team does a great job discussing hot technology topics. While at the Tampa Bay Florida stop of the .NET Rocks! Visual Studio 2012 Launch Road Trip, <a href="http://dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=821" target="_blank">Carl Franklin and Richard Campbell talked to me about building Single Page Applications (SPAs)</a>. You can listen to the interview online here or <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/dnr/dotnetrocks_0821_papa.mp3">download the interview from this link</a>. We discussed what a SPA is, the many technologies you can use to build one, when to build one, and took several questions and comments form the live audience.
