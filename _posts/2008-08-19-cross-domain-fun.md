<p>Has this type of thing ever happened to you? Sometimes its best to put the keyboard down and walk away from the computer. Last night I was reminded of this when I was writing some code examples for my Silverlight book and struggling with a problem with my WCF service. The problem was that it worked.</p>  <p>No, I am not crazy (well not completely). I had a Silverlight client and a WCF service on a different domain. Both use the Cassini web server with different ports on the localhost. I did not include a ClientAccessPolicy.xml file with the service, yet it ran fine. I checked to make sure it was not a hidden file (you know, show files in Visual Studio). Nope, it was not there. </p>  <p>Next I ran the Web Development Helper tool to check if Silverlight was even looking for the ClientAccessPolicy.xml file. It wasn’t. So then I checked to make sure the domains were indeed different. They were. What the heck was going on!!!!</p>  <p>Every time I ran the application the Silverlight UI loaded itself with data. Where was it coming from? Where was it coming from? Where was it coming from?</p>  <p>Then it hit me … I had put first tested the app with dummy data. Basically commented out the service call with loading hard coded data as a test at one point early on. So everything was working&#160; just fine … there was no cross domain call.</p>  <p>I am ashamed to say that this whole process took me about 20-30 minutes to figure out. It was about 2am which explains a lot. Lesson learned … sleep more than 4 hours a night!</p><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/kick/?url=/all/cross-domain-fun/"><img src="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/Services/Images/KickItImageGenerator.ashx?url=/all/cross-domain-fun/&amp;bgcolor=0080C0&amp;fgcolor=FFFFFF&amp;border=000000&amp;cbgcolor=D4E1ED&amp;cfgcolor=000000" alt="DotNetKicks Image" border="0/"></a></div><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><script type="text/javascript"><!-- var dzone_url = '/all/cross-domain-fun/'; var dzone_title = 'Cross Domain Fun'; var dzone_blurb = 'Cross Domain Fun'; var dzone_style = '1'; --></script><script language="javascript" src="http://widgets.dzone.com/widgets/zoneit.js"></script> </div>
