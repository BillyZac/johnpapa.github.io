<P><A HREF="/blogs/john.papa/archive/2006/06/20/146617.aspx">2 days ago I posted about my frustrating experiences with Resharper v2</A>,&nbsp;specifically&nbsp;how when I type there is a delay in characters appearing. It was really slowing me down and causing me to stop and repeat my steps. I sent a note to <A href="http://www.jetbrains.com/">JetBrains </A>support and sent them a sample project of mine so they could try to repeat it. The project was small with only a handful of files. The files were all small too.</P> <P>This morning I got a message from them saying that they were able to reproduce the problem and are working on a solution. Its not fixed yet, but I am impressed with the quick responses and service that I have received from their support team. Hopefully the fix will be out soon, too.</P>
