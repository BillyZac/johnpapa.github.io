<P mce_keep="true">Last week the Orcas Beta 1 was made available for download by Microsoft. It is madeup of 8 large RAR files and can be downlaoded from here: <A href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa700831.aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa700831.aspx</A></P> <P mce_keep="true">Some of my excitement was tempered a bit when&nbsp;a bug was found that caused problems with the EDM Wizard. The team was quick to respond and they have already released a patch for it, as posted on their web site:</P> <BLOCKQUOTE> <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=3><SPAN style="COLOR: #1f497d; FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Late last week, after bits had been finalized, we found a bug in the ADO.NET Entity Data Model Wizard that shipped with Visual Studio “Orcas” beta 1.

Only 1.5 hours&nbsp;of which is focussed on Orcas ... but I still had to review all of the beta 1 tools to make sure my samples still work for May 10th's workshop. So far everything seems fine, but I am glad the patch came out so I can fully test the walk throughs, too. That is the fun of presenting beta topics (or pre-beta topics). :)</P> <P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
