If you want to get a head start on ASP.NET 2, check out the <A href="http://beta.asp.net/QUICKSTART/aspnet/default.aspx">ASP.NET 2 QuickStarts Tutorial</A>. It's all beta, so of course treat it as such.&nbsp;I've played with a few of them and there is some decent stuff out there already. Code samples are avaialble in C# or VB.NET, as well.
