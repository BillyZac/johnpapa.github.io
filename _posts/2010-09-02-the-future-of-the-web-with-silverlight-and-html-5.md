<p>Lately there has been a lot of buzz speculating on the future of the web including HTML 5, Silverlight, and other web technologies. <a href="http://jpapa.me/futurewsl">Brad Becker, Director of Product management at Microsoft, has posted some valuable insight into the value of Silverlight and the role it does and will play in the web</a> (including where it and HTML 5 will play key roles). </p>  <p>I highly recommend that anyone considering the future of web technologies go check out the article and leave your comments on the site. For those who are more visual/auditory, Brad also has linked to a video where he presents <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/silverlight-4-launch/sessions/">more about the role of Silverlight at this link</a>.</p>
