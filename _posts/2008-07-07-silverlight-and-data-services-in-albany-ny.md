<p>I just confirmed that on Tuesday July 22nd I will be in Albany, NY for an INETA sponsored user group meeting with the Tech Valley .NET User Group. I used to live in Albany so its going to be fun to check out the area and the user group. The session is titled Data Services with Silverlight 2 and here are just a few items I will be demonstrating:</p>  <ul>   <li>Silverlight data binding</li>    <li>Using WCF with Silverlight </li>    <li>Parsing XML with LINQ to XML </li>    <li>Using REST services from Silverlight </li> </ul>  <p></p>  <p>I have a lot of material to go through so I need to cut it down to the 1.5 to 2 hour time frame for the meeting. This topic is near and dear to me and it coincides well with my upcoming book with O’Reilly titled Data Services with Silverlight 2 due out in December 2008.</p>  <p>If you are in the Albany NY area on Tuesday July 22nd, please stop by and check things out. You can find out more on their web site at <a href="http://www.tvug.net">www.tvug.net</a> </p>  <p>Here is the abstract for the session …</p>  <p>Silverlight enables developers to use their .NET and XAML skills to develop Rich Internet Applications and to build data driven Silverlight applications that communicate with multi-tier architectures. This session will show how to build Silverlight 2 applications that communicate with and consume REST services and use LINQ to XML to manage XML content, show the various data binding techniques, and show how to use WCF to talk to various middle tier services including custom entity models and the Entity Framework.</p><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/kick/?url=/all/silverlight-and-data-services-in-albany-ny/"><img src="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/Services/Images/KickItImageGenerator.ashx?url=/all/silverlight-and-data-services-in-albany-ny/&amp;bgcolor=0080C0&amp;fgcolor=FFFFFF&amp;border=000000&amp;cbgcolor=D4E1ED&amp;cfgcolor=000000" border="0/"></a></div><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_url = '/all/silverlight-and-data-services-in-albany-ny/';</script><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_title = 'Silverlight and Data Services in Albany, NY';</script><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_blurb = 'Silverlight and Data Services in Albany, NY';</script><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_style = '1';</script><script language="javascript" src="http://widgets.dzone.com/widgets/zoneit.js"></script> </div>
