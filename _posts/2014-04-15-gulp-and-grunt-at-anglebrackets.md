<p>I love JavaScript and task automation is a key ingredient to building awesome browser based apps. Today I presented how I prefer to do task automation using gulp.js and contrasted it to grunt.js at AngleBrackets, a newer web conference. I'll be blogging more about these and putting a course out, but for now here are the slides from the conference and you can find the <a href="http://github.com/johnpapa/ng-demos">grunt and gulp demos here</a>.</p>
