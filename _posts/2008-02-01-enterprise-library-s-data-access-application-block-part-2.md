<P>In the&nbsp;<A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/08/default.aspx">August 2005 issue of MSDN Magazine</A> I continued my discussion of the Enterprise Libraryâ€™s Data Access Application Block. This is <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/08/DataPoints/default.aspx">part 2</A> in a 3 part series where I explore the Enterprise Library DAAB <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/07/DataPoints/default.aspx">in my Data Points column</A>.&nbsp;I had a lot of&nbsp;good feedback from&nbsp;part 1, which I will try to answer in my blog and possibly in a future follow up article. I have been surprised at how many people&nbsp;are so interested in Ent Lib&nbsp;in general. Its not a solution for everything, but it certainly does have great value and the development community appears to be very interested in it. </P> <P>You can read the article <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/08/DataPoints/default.aspx">online here</A>. If you want to read Part 1 first, you can catch that <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/07/DataPoints/default.aspx">online here</A>.</P><A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/08/default.aspx"><IMG src="/photos/jpapa/images/129712/original.aspx" border=0></A>
