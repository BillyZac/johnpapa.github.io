<p>I recently had an opportunity to review an advance copy of Julie Lerman and Rowan Miller's new book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1449312942?t=johnpanet-20">Programming Entity Framework 4.1 Code First</a>". In short, this is a fantastic book that is a quick read.<a href="http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2011/11/28/an-entity-framework-book-worth-your-time.aspx"> Read more about my review in Papa's Perspective</a>.</p>
