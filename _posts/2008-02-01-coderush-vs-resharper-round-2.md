<P>To add to <A HREF="/blogs/john.papa/archive/2005/10/23/133590.aspx">my last post on comparing Resharper and CodeRush</A>&nbsp;... I spent some more time with each of these products and something that stuck out right away was that they don;t play well together. I had several features run into each other (intellisense, templates, and keys that do different things) Yeah, I should have expected this and I guess deep down I did, but I was holding out hope that I could use both simultaneously. So I had to turn 1 off to truly test the other and then vice versa. It was a bit annoying that if I turned off <A href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/CodeRush/">CodeRush </A>in the add-ins menu that it would unload, then reload. I had to close Visual Studio.NET to get it to stay unloaded. Like a telemarketer it just wouldn't stop getting in my face! I did not have this problem with <A href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">Resharper </A>as once I unloaded it it stayed down. While this was annoying, I can't condemn the product for this, not if it turns out to be better for development (jury is still out in my mind as I give them both a fair shake).</P> <P>Another thing that I noticed is that it takes about 1 minute to load my massive project into Visual Studio.NET&nbsp;when <A href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">Resharper&nbsp;</A>is running. It likely is loading&nbsp;all of its metadata,&nbsp;which&nbsp;caused&nbsp;my project to go from taking about 15 seconds to load to about 55 seconds.&nbsp;Not killer, but still an annoyance. <A href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/CodeRush/">CodeRush </A>did not provide any noticeable delay to the loading of my project, which really stood out. But if I have to live with a delay at load time to gain the "Find Usages" and the "Analysis/Code Checking" features of <A href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">Resharper</A>, I'll take the good with the bad.</P> <P>So far I haven't seen any compelling evidence (although there are some very useful features) that would cause me to use <A href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/CodeRush/">CodeRush </A>over <A href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">Resharper</A>. Although, I am still going to delve deeper into both to see what else there might be that I am missing. </P> <P>If you have had experience comparing the 2 products, what did you find?</P>
