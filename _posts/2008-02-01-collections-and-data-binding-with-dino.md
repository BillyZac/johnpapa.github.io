<P>For a look at a non ADO.NET solution ... <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/despos/">Dino Esposito</A> wrote an article called <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/05/CuttingEdge/default.aspx">Collections and Data Binding</A> in a recent <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag">MSDN Magazine</A> issue. Its a good read and addresses how to bind collections to controls, as opposed to using ADO.NET objects for binding. I believe he is going to follow this up with a discussion of collections vs DataSets in a future issue.</P> <P>&nbsp;</P>
