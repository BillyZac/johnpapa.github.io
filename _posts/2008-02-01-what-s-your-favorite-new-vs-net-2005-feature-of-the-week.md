<P>This week I have been spending some free time in the reviewing the VS.NET 2005 Release Candidate. There are some nice features in the product that I am really excited about such as the new data designers and the TableAdapter in ADO.NET 2. Of course the oft discussed generics are pretty awesome, too. Partial classes, an oldie but goodie (hard to believe that feature seems like it has been around so long and its not in a live version yet). I'll be posting what I find in the VS.NET 2005 RC in the very near future. </P> <P>Thereis a lot to talk about!&nbsp;"Edit and continue", generics, code snippets, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is your favorite new feature? [ at least for this week :-) ]</P>
