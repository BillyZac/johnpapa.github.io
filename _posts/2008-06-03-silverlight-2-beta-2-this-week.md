<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2008/06/03/on-stage-at-the-teched-2008-keynote.aspx"><u>Somasegar</u></a> was on-stage today at TechEd and announced that Silverlight 2 Beta 2 is going to be released with a GoLive license this week. This also will include a Blend 2.5 June 2008 Preview and tools to VS2008. Iâ€™m looking forward to getting the bits this week and working them into <a href="/all/silverlight-2-book-cover-mock-up/">my Silverlight book</a>!</p>  <p>The good news (for me) is that nothing I have written about in the first few chapters of my book has changed. The better news is that there are a lot of improvements to items that I will be writing about in the book, so I get to take advantage of them and pass them along. I was going to write about how to sort and do tricks with the DataGrid using some code I wrote, but now it looks like it is baked in. </p>  <p>Here are some of the highlights for Silverlight Beta 2 from the session:</p>  <li><strong>Deep Zoom:</strong> </li>  <ul>   <li>improved event driven notifications</li>    <li>new XML-based file format for Deep Zoom image tiles</li>    <li>new MultiScaleTileSource </li> </ul>  <li><strong>UI Framework</strong></li>  <ul>   <li>more WPF UI features now in Silverlight </li>    <li>enhanced </li>    <ul>     <li>animation </li>      <li>error handling </li>      <li>automation and accessibility </li>      <li>keyboard input </li>      <li>performance</li>   </ul> </ul>  <li><strong>Networking Support</strong></li>  <ul>   <li>Improved Cross Domain support </li>    <li>Security enhancements </li>    <li>Upload support via WebClient</li>    <li>LINQ-to-JSON is now included (formerly a prototype)</li>    <li>ADO.NET Data Services support (aka Astoria)</li>    <li>Improved SOAP support </li> </ul>  <li><strong>Rich Controls</strong></li>  <ul>   <li>Visual State Manager</li>    <ul>     <li> New and easier templating model </li>   </ul>    <li>New TabControl</li>    <li>TextBox</li>    <ul>     <li>text wrapping</li>      <li>scrollbars</li>   </ul>    <li>DataGrid</li>    <ul>     <li>Autosize </li>      <li>Reorder</li>      <li>Sort </li>   </ul> </ul><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:right; margin:0px; padding:4px 0px 4px 0px;"><a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/kick/?url=/all/silverlight-2-beta-2-this-week/"><img src="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/Services/Images/KickItImageGenerator.ashx?url=/all/silverlight-2-beta-2-this-week/&amp;bgcolor=0080C0&amp;fgcolor=FFFFFF&amp;border=000000&amp;cbgcolor=D4E1ED&amp;cfgcolor=000000" border="0/"></a></div>
