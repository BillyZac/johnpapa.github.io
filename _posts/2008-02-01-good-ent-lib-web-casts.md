<H2>Enterprise Library</H2><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/practices"><IMG border="0" alt="Patterns and Practices home" src="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/pponline.gif"></A> <BR> <P>There are some really good <A href="http://www.pnplive.com/">webcasts</A> on the different <A href="http://www.pnplive.com/">Enterprise Library Application Blocks</A>. You can download the slides, watch the video and grab some hands on code samples <A href="http://www.pnplive.com/">here</A>. There's also some goober photos of <A href="http://www.ronjacobs.com/">Ron Jacobs</A> and the crew ;-)</P> <P>The web casts are over with (just ended last week), but the video and materials are all up on the site now. I've watched a few of the webcasts and I think they were well organized and presented.&nbsp; Good stuff if you are trying to get up to speed on what they do and how/when to use them.</P>
