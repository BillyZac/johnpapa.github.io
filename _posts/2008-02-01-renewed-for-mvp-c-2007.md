<div class="Section1"><p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Tahoma','sans-serif'">I am very happy to say that I have been renewed as an MVP (C#) for 2007. Special thanks to my MVP lead and the MVP team for renewing me. I have not checked out all the new MVP&rsquo;s on the list yet, but I congratulate all of you who were renewed or were awarded the MVP for the first time!</span><span style="font-size: 10pt"></span></p></div>
