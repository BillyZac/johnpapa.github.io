<p>I am setting up my schedule for the first quarter of 2008, and the first .NET user group I will be heading to as an <a href="http://www.ineta.org">INETA</a> speaker in 2008 is the <a href="http://scdnug.org/default.aspx">Space Coast .NET User Group in Melbourne, Florida</a>. I will be presenting an approximately 2 hour long session on the Entity Framework including what it is, why you should care, how it works, and how to use it in practical applications. I enjoy presenting a user groups because the people are usually very interactive. The user group format lends itself well to having good discussions about hot topics since everyone can contribute due to the laid back atmosphere. I hope you can join us and stop by to say hi!</p> <p>You can see more information about the event and register for it <a href="https://www.clicktoattend.com/invitation.aspx?code=122449">at this link</a>. </p> <p>The date of the event is: 2/20/2008, and we will be meeting from 6:30 PM - 8:30 PM.
