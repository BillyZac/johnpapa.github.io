<P mce_keep="true">After what feels like a year of h#ll that it took me and my family to move to Florida, I finally made it. It is still ongoing to get everything settled, but once I do get all set up I will get back to blogging and writing and speaking a bit more. I took 2 months off of writing and speaking, but now things are kicking back in gear. </P> <P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P> <P mce_keep="true"><A class="" href="http://www.simple-talk.com/dotnet/.net-framework/.net-3.5-language-enhancements/" mce_href="http://www.simple-talk.com/dotnet/.net-framework/.net-3.5-language-enhancements/">You can find&nbsp;my latest article</A> on <A class="" href="http://www.simple-talk.com/" mce_href="http://www.simple-talk.com">Simple-Talk</A>. This one explains some of the new features in C# that are coming in VS 2008 and .NET 3.5 including anonymous types, object initializers, collection initializers, automatic properties, and implicitly typed variables. Many of these useful features are also the foundation for using LINQ. Anyway, I hope you enjoy this article. I will be speaking at several conference later this summer and this fall. I hope to see some of you there.</P> <P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
