<div class="Section1"> <p class="MsoNormal">Wow. I admit that I take for granted the daily use of copy and paste features for hundreds of daily tasks. This past weekend I was creating PowerPoint slides for the upcoming Las Vegas <span class="MsoHyperlink">DevConnections conference in November</a></span> and I was copying and pasting some visual images repeatedly on the page. These were simple images, but being the horribly ungifted artist I was in no mood to recreate the image, I just wanted to copy and paste it a few times and change the text (I was using them to represent classes). Anyway, I soon found that copy and paste was not working. It just suddenly stopped. I then tried to copy/paste in Word, Outlook, NotePad, Quicken, and several other programs to no avail. </p> <p class="MsoNormal" mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal">Anyway to avoid what was becoming a huge inconvenience I realized that I could copy and paste within my VPC image of Visual Studio 2008. Once I did that, I was able to copy and paste once again everywhere else. This bewildered me. So I did some searching on the web and found a few other people had run across the same issue. It appears that when running a VPC image there are times when copy/paste ceases to function on your entire PC. All you have to do is copy and paste within the VPC and its all back to good.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal">I canâ€™t confirm the exact nature of this issue nor do I claim to really care <span style="font-family: wingdings">J</span>. I am just happy I got my copy/paste back!</p></div>
