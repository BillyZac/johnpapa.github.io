<p>Long ago, in a galaxy far far away I met with&nbsp; <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jongalloway">Jon Galloway</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JesseLiberty">Jesse Liberty</a> to brainstorm on some MVVM ideas. I had forgotten about this video recording, and I guess they did too. But now, many months later they dug it up and you can now check it out at Channel 9 on their show, The Full Stack. </p><iframe style="width: 512px; height: 288px" src="http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/The-Full-Stack/The-Full-Stack-Part-14-Taking-a-look-at-MVVM-with-John-Papa/player?w=512&amp;h=288" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
