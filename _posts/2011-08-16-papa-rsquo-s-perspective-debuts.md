<p>I loved writing my Data Points column in MSDN Magazine &hellip; sometimes I find it hard to believe I wrote for them for over 11 years! Since I love writing, and specifically I love writing columns, I <a href="http://visualstudiomagazine.com/Blogs/OnWard-and-UpWard/2011/08/John-Papa-Joins-Visual-Studio-Magazine.aspx">recently started writing a column</a> for <a href="http://visualstudiomagazine.com/Home.aspx">Visual Studio Magazine</a> called Papa&rsquo;s Perspective. I&rsquo;ll be writing a short column each month about cutting edge technologies and I invite you to please check them out. This column will give me a great outlet to share my perspective on the latest technology trends.</p>
<p>Along with the print and online editions of the magazine, I will also be penning some online posts for them. <a href="http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2011/08/15/fundamental-mvvm.aspx">The first post can now be seen here where I talk about reducing the noise around MVVM Fundamentals</a>.&nbsp; The first article should appear in the September 2011 edition of VS Mag, where I talk about JavaScript patterns.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy them!</p>
