<p></p>  <p></p>  <p>I am building a Twitter client using Silverlight and a <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> API service I pulled together using REST services. Its nothing fancy by any means, but it got me thinking “hey John, this would be a great addition to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Data-Services-Silverlight-John-Papa/dp/0596523092/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1218389224&amp;sr=8-1">your Silverlight book</a>”. So I decided to put it in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Data-Services-Silverlight-John-Papa/dp/0596523092/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1218389224&amp;sr=8-1">Data Services and Silverlight 2</a> book when I discuss REST services. Problem is that I already talk about other REST services, like Amazon, so I need to make sure I do not get carried away with the services and instead I focus on how to interact with them.</p>  <p>The Twitter client likely won’t encompass everything I want it to due to time constraints for the book, but it will be a good starting point. However I will continue to work on it and distribute it via something like CodePlex to whomever is interested once I get it in good shape. Eventually I will likely turn it into a WPF application so it can sit on the desktop. But I will also keep a Silverlight version so it can exist in a web page amongst other cool stuff. </p>  <p>So if you were looking for a Twitter client, what would it include? I definitely want a searching feature, basic tweet replies, direct messages, etc. Anything else?</p><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/kick/?url=/all/if-i-was-building-a-twitter-client-i-would-hellip/"><img src="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/Services/Images/KickItImageGenerator.ashx?url=/all/if-i-was-building-a-twitter-client-i-would-hellip/&amp;bgcolor=0080C0&amp;fgcolor=FFFFFF&amp;border=000000&amp;cbgcolor=D4E1ED&amp;cfgcolor=000000" alt="DotNetKicks Image" border="0/"></a></div><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><script type="text/javascript"><!-- var dzone_url = '/all/if-i-was-building-a-twitter-client-i-would-hellip/'; var dzone_title = 'If I Was Building a Twitter Client, I Would …'; var dzone_blurb = 'If I Was Building a Twitter Client, I Would …'; var dzone_style = '1'; --></script><script language="javascript" src="http://widgets.dzone.com/widgets/zoneit.js"></script> </div>
