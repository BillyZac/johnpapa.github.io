<p>The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/07/default.aspx">July 2005 issue of MSDN Magazine</a> is now available online. The amount of discussion that has surrounded the Enterprise Library and its Application Blocks (good, bad and indifferent) has been tremendous. I decided to create a 3 part series that explores the Enterprise Library Data Access blocks <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/07/DataPoints/default.aspx">in my Data Points column</a>. In this issue I discuss how how the Enterprise Library DAAB fits into an architecture as well as some best practices in using the block. I review the Enterprise Library model and dive right into the DAAB and its configuration and cryptography features, when and where the DAAB can be used, and lots more. </p> <p>There is a lot to review with Ent Lib and only so much fits into an article, so I decided to split this up into a 3 parter. In the upcoming Part 2 and Part 3 I explore how post build events can be used to ease the use of configuration files, several ways of retrieving data, saving data, transactions with Ent Lib, using NUnit with&nbsp;Ent Lib, and its factory model.</p> <center><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/06/default.aspx"><img src="/blogs/john.papa/default.aspx//photos/jpapa/images/63035/original.aspx" align="center" border="0" /></img></a>&nbsp;</center>
