<p>Tonight is opening night for the NFL season! This year NBC will showing the Sunday Night Football games in HD via Silverlight. You can catch the games at <a href="http://snfextra.nbcsports.com/">http://snfextra.nbcsports.com/</a></p>  <p>It’s just a few minutes into the opening night game and I am watching it side by side with my HD TV to get a comparison. The HD broadcast in Silverlight is quote impressive! But the features built into the Silverlight app are even more impressive. There is a chat window for fans, stats, videos, and game information on the right hand side of the video. There is also a button at the bottom named “Key Plays”. When clicked it displays an area that is reserved for recapping key plays in the game. The video, of course, has DVR features too. I am not taking a screenshot for fear of copyright protection … but if you are interested in it, go ahead and check it out. </p>  <p>It really is quite cool! </p>
