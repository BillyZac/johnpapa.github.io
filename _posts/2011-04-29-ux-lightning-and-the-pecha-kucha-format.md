<p><a href="http://jpapa.me/uxlsurvey">Please take a moment to take this quick survey</a> about the <a href="/mix11uxlpost">UX Lightning sessions</a> at MIX11 and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecha_Kucha">Pecha Kucha format</a> we used. The survey (which ends in a few days)&nbsp; is 5 questions and only takes a minute, but will be very valuable for future event planning.</p> <p>Thanks!</p>
