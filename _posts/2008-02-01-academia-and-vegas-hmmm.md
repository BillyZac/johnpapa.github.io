<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT size=2>On Veteran's Day weekend I will be presenting at the Microsoft Academic Alliance conference in <?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Las Vegas</st1:place></st1:City>. When&nbsp;I was first asked about this I had to take a step back ... <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Las Vegas</st1:place></st1:City> .... Academics? They just don't seem to mix ... but hey, I'm game! In all seriousness, I am looking forward to presenting at this conference as the attendees all make their livings in the academic world. It seems like a great opportunity to see what and how the teachers/professors are teaching the college students. It will be interesting to hear their questions to see how they view the fast changing world of development with .NET. <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/despos">Dino Esposito </A>will be there as well as a few other presenters. I'm looking forward to saying hi to my old friend <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/despos">Dino </A>as I have not seen him in a few years now. <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p></o:p></FONT></FONT></P> <P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT size=2>Oh, and I'll be sure to play Red 19 when I take a break from the craps table! :-)<o:p></o:p></FONT></FONT></P> <P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
