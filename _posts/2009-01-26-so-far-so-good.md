<p>Its been about a month since my book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596523092/johnpanet-20">Data Driven Services with Silverlight 2</a> hit the stores just around Christmas. That last week of December I imagine people wanted to do other things like spend time with their families :), I know I did. But now that its had some time to permeate the market, the early reviews are starting to come in. So far its looking good … there are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/product/0596523092/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?_encoding=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1">six 4 or 5 star reviews on Amazon</a> (including one by <a href="http://www.timheuer.com">Tim Heuer</a>) and some early blog reviews, such as <a href="http://www.nxtgenug.net/Article.aspx?ArticleID=319">this detailed review</a> from <a href="http://www.nxtgenug.net/Article.aspx?ArticleID=319">Richard Costall of NxtGenUG</a>. (Thanks to everyone who wrote the reviews!)</p>  <p>Some people have asked what’s next for Silverlight 3 … and frankly I’d love to follow this up with an updated version for v3. It’s all about interest. So if you like the book, let my publisher O’Reilly Media know :-)</p>  <p>It’s always nerve racking reading other people’s opinions of your work, especially when that work took so&#160; much time and effort and is now in front of anyone who wants to look at it. There were times I rewrote entire sections of the book just to get the flow working better. Eventually, you just have to let it go and see if it flies or not.</p>  <p>While I am sure my book won’t please everyone out there, I am pleased with the early indications. So far so good.</p>
