It's almost here! I can feel the end approaching for my new beginner level SPA JumpStart course for <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com" target="_blank">Pluralsight </a>(hooray!). I think you're going to enjoy it as much as I enjoyed creating it!

I am targeting for it be available mid March 2013. This course fits in nicely to jumpstart SPA development and get you moving quickly and efficiently. This is an end to end course that starts from File | New project and builds a fully functional SPA with multiple pages, insert, update, delete, validation, and more. I'll reveal much more about the course in this blog post series. And yes, it will include <a href="http://johnpapa.net/hottowel" target="_blank">Hot Towel</a> and <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/asp-net-spa-templates/" target="_blank">some of the new Visual Studio SPA Templates</a> too :)

For now, here is a quick video I compiled to demonstrate just a small piece of what you will be able to build after watching my new SPA JumpStart course.

<h3>Approach to My Existing Intermediate Level SPA Course</h3>
And now for some background context ...

When I set out to record <a href="http://jpapa.me/spaps" target="_blank">my intermediate level SPA course</a>, I purposefully demonstrated how to create all of the code, why I went town those paths, and hand crafted much of the code. The code was involved in some cases (think the data service module and its related modules) but it got across the point: <strong>you can build a robust app as a SPA</strong> without any magic. At the time, and to an extent still today, SPA was widely a misunderstood or unknown. Thus, the approach I took was purposefully targeting a wide spectrum of possibilities that you can explore with a SPA. I also avoided magical frameworks that "do it all" for you, because the journey (in this case) is more important than the end result. Otherwise, I could just show a wizard :)

This approach was arguably successful, and somewhat unconventional. The problem is that I started the story in the middle of the book, which caused some to wonder how to start. I totally get that and that's a problem I can deal with and have addressed with my new course SPA JumpStart. 

<h3>Approach to My New SPA JumpStart SPA Course</h3>
I cover tools in my new SPA JumpStart course that handle most of my data management and view and viewmodel composition. These tools are fantastic and hide a lot of the complexity that I hand rolled into the intermediate course. I also demonstrate some NuGet packages and Visual Studio 2012 Templates that I think you will really like, as I created these specifically for this course. I'll explore these and many other areas through the course and this blog post series.

<h3>Tell Me Again?</h3>
To sum up the differences, this course provides a beginner's jump-start to getting running with a SPA quickly. You'll have all the fundamentals in place and get to join me in walking through building all of the code with me. The intermediate course covers more topics, how to build more of the components manually, discusses many of the choices you can make, and covers some scenarios in more depth such as HTML5 Boilerplate, Web Optimization, Web API design, building rich data capabilities manually, and Responsive Web Design (and more). 
 
Or for a really short summary:
<ul>
<li>SPA JumpStart --> Teach me the core and "how"</li>
<li><a href="http://jpapa.me/spaps" target="_blank">SPA Intermediate</a> --> Teach me more depth, more topics, and more "why"</li>
</ul>
