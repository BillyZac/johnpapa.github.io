<p>I love networking. Talking to the community and sharing stories, technology or otherwise, it’s the best part of my career. Tomorrow morning I get to try a new way to meet some new folks, and rehash with some good friends. That’s one reason I enjoy Twitter so much.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?home=&amp;gid=43315&amp;trk=anet_ug_hm"><img style="margin: 5px 5px 5px 0px; display: inline; float: left" title="Linked.NET Users Group (LIDNUG)" alt="Linked.NET Users Group (LIDNUG)" align="left" src="http://media03.linkedin.com/media/p/1/000/02d/0b4/1ae36e9.png" width="100" height="50" /></a>Tomorrow morning I am doing my first (of what I hope is many) Linked IN .NET User Group events. The format is wide open and you can talk to me about patterns, Silverlight, SQL Server, data access, soccer, football, exercise, MIX, my Silverlight MIXer parties, or whatever else you can think of. I’m really looking forward to some good conversations. For those that know me, you know I’ll always tell it as straight as I can. If I don’t know, I’ll let you know that too. </p>  <p>Here is some information you will need to join in the conversation. Please stop by and follow me on Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/john_papa">http://twitter.com/john_papa</a> … where you can engage me in a conversation anytime.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>John Papa - Silverlight Q&amp;A      <br />Friday 21 January, 2011 9AM-10:30AM PT       <br />Register: <a href="http://lidnug-johnpapa.eventbrite.com/">http://lidnug-johnpapa.eventbrite.com/</a></p> </blockquote>  <p>And it looks like both <a href="http://www.orcsweb.com">OrcsWeb</a> and <a href="http://www.telerik.com">Telerik</a> are sponsoring the event … both are great companies and have some awesome folks who I have had the privilege to meet and call friends.</p>  <p>UPDATE: I noticed the folks from <a href="http://www.typemock.com">Typemock</a> are also sponsoring and giving away some licenses of their product … very cool.</p>  <p>A few good links for LIDNUG, too:</p>  <ul>   <li>Official LIDNUG Home: <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=43315">http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=43315</a></li>    <li>Unofficial LIDNUG site: <a href="http://www.lidnug.org">http://www.lidnug.org</a></li>    <li>Follow us on Twitter: <a href="http://www.twitter.com/lidnug">http://www.twitter.com/lidnug</a></li> </ul>  <p>And don’t forget to tune in this coming Monday for LIDNUG event with <a href="http://twitter.com/scottgu">Scott Guthrie</a>.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Scott Guthrie Talks Shop VIII      <br />Monday 24 January, 2011 3PM-4:30PM PT       <br />Register: <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Flidnug-scottgu8%2Eeventbrite%2Ecom%2F&amp;urlhash=YjP0&amp;_t=tracking_anet">http://lidnug-scottgu8.eventbrite.com/</a></p></blockquote>
