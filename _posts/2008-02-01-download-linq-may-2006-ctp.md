<P>The latest <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=1e902c21-340c-4d13-9f04-70eb5e3dceea&amp;displaylang=en">LINQ CTP</A> is now up on the MSDN public web site <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=1e902c21-340c-4d13-9f04-70eb5e3dceea&amp;displaylang=en">right here</A>. Some of the new features are pretty cool including the JOIN syntax and its enhancements and LINQ over ADO.NET DataSets. Lucky for me it came out just in time for me to be able to demonstrate some of its features next week in my <A href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2006/orlando/workshops.aspx#7">full day Data Access workshop </A>at the <A href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2006/orlando/">Orlando VSLive</A>.</P> <P>Iâ€™ve been really enjoying the new features. Still a ways to go, but it looks great so far!</P> <P>&nbsp;</P> <P>NOTE: You can get more info on the LINQ project at the main <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/data/ref/linq/">LINQ Project web site</A>.</P>
