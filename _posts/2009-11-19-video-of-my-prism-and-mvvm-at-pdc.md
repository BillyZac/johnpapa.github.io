<p>We had a fantastic turnout yesterday for my session at <a href="http://www.microsoftpdc.com/">PDC</a> on <a href="http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/CL22">Advanced Large Scale Applications with Microsoft Silverlight</a>. The room was packed and there were so many great questions that they ended up kicking me out of the room! LOL Thanks so much for everyone for attending. It is obvious that there is a lot of interest in building large Silverlight applications, ones that use MVVM, and how to use Prism. Iâ€™ll be posting my code from the demos I showed later this evening once I get back to Redmond and get on a faster network connection.</p>  <p>You can view the video for my presentation <a title="Advanced Topics for Building Large-Scale Applications with Microsoft Silverlight" href="http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/CL22">Advanced Topics for Building Large-Scale Applications with Microsoft Silverlight</a> here. You can fid the slide deck for my presentation # CL22 from <a href="http://microsoftpdc.com/Videos">this link too</a>.</p>  <p>And be sure to check back late tonight for the code samples!</p>
