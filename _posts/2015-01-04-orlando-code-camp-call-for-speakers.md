The Call for Speakers is now open for the 10th Annual Orlando Code Camp on Saturday, March 28th.  Last year we had over 625 attendees, with over 50 speakers and 72 sessions.

This event keeps getting bigger and better every year and what better way to spend your Saturday in late March than in the awesome Florida weather!

This is an awesome event and we always draw a great group of speakers and attendees.  Thanks to our amazing sponsors, volunteers, and speakers, the event is 100% free and includes a great Speaker party, breakfast, lunch, after-party, and some very good prizes.  And of course, great content!

You can sign up at <a href="http://www.OrlandoCodeCamp.com">www.OrlandoCodeCamp.com</a>. Deadline for session submittal is January 25th with approvals being sent out by February 1st.

I'll be presenting 2 sessions: 1 on Angular and 1 on Gulp. Whether you are planning on presenting or attending, I look forward to meeting you!
