<p>I love to read. I don;t read enough, well, there can’t be enough :) … but I wish I had more to read as my book list keeps growing faster than I read. I’m an early adopter for many tech items, but the steep price tag for the Amazon Kindle v1 was too much for me to throw at something I had no experience with. Just like the iPhone v1, I felt it was worth waiting a year to see how it fared, to see if Amazon stuck with it, see it first hand, and make sure books were going to be available in its format. </p> <center><iframe style="border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-bottom-style: none" border="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=johnpanet-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=12&amp;l=ur1&amp;category=kindle&amp;banner=1RR50DN6TK7D02JARP02&amp;f=ifr" frameborder="0" width="300" scrolling="no" height="250"></iframe></center>  <p>I have had a chance to play with the Kindle and recently I decided I was going to give one a try when the net version came out. I was very happy with the feel of the Kindle and most importantly to me, it was easy on my eyes. Often with books I hold them with one hand at a time laying down, sitting, standing at the exercise machine … trying to stay comfortable. Sometimes my eyes get tired and I wish I could increase the font size. My biggest hurdle to the Kindle was my uneasiness over the strain it might put on my eyes. In the brief time I borrowed a Kindle v1, I was amazed at the screen. I am so used to LCD’s with their backlighting that I assumed my eyes would hurt, but they did not. So I will be giving the Kindle v2 a shot … <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00154JDAI?tag=johnpanet-20">I pre-ordered one on Amazon</a> yesterday, hoping to get one when they are released on February 24th. I’ll be reviewing it on my blog as I go through the motions with it.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00154JDAI?tag=johnpanet-20"><img height="143" alt="Kindle2" src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/associates/2009/banners/k2-email_002._V251584110_.jpg" width="480" align="left" border="0" /></a></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>You can read more about the Kindle 2 at Amazon, but the highlights to me of the new version are:</p>  <p>- Reported longer battery life</p>  <p>- Reported ability to read PDF and Word documents</p>  <p>- More storage</p>  <p>- Large selection of books</p>  <p>- Slimmer form factor (no more angular geometric shapes. Now thin and sleek)</p>
