<p><a href="http://www.nerddinner.com/1103">On Wednesday October 7th at 6:30pm several of the Florida.NET crew and I are gathering at Champps sports bar at the Tampa International Plaza Mall</a>. <a href="/silverlight/next-stop-redmond-wa/">I will be moving out to Redmond</a> the following week so this is a great chance for me personally to see a lot of people before I head out. I believe Nikita and Joe Healy reserved the second floor of Champps, so we will have plenty of room to spread out. If you are in Tampa that day, please stop by and have a bite or a drink with me.</p>  <p>I’ll be speaking at VSLive Orlando Tuesday and Wednesday on a few topics (of course including Silverlight). Then I will drive over to Tampa and meet everyone at 6:30pm.</p>  <p>Details below … click the link to register</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>John Papa Goodbye Tampa, FL Dinner</strong></p>    <p><a href="http://feeds.technorati.com/events/http://www.nerddinner.com/1103">Add event to your calendar (iCal) </a></p>    <p><strong>When:</strong> <abbr>Oct 07, 2009 <strong>@</strong> 6:30 PM </abbr></p>    <p><strong>Where:</strong> 2223 North West Shore, Tampa, FL 33607, USA <abbr>Geolocation for hCalendar</abbr></p>    <p><strong>Description:</strong> @John_Papa going away party - John's moving to Redmond.
