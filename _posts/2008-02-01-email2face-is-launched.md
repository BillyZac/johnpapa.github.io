<P>So a few months ago the idea for <A href="http://www.email2face.com/">email2face</A> was bubbling around <A href="http://www.aspsoft.com/">ASPSOFT</A>. The concept is that&nbsp;we are often communicating with people through email, IM, blogs and other electronic forums without ever knowing what they look like. I could bump right into someone from CodeBetter.com and never know who they were. <A href="http://www.email2face.com/">email2face </A>addresses this by simply allowing us to <A href="http://www.email2face.com/FindAFace.aspx">find people by their email address</A> and showing a photo of that person. Of course for it to work you have to <A href="http://www.email2face.com/AddYourFace.aspx">add your email address and photo</A> for someone to find it.</P> <P><A href="http://www.email2face.com/" target=_blank><IMG height=49 src="/photos/jpapa/images/141794/468x60.aspx" width=400 border=0></A></P> <P>Anyway, its a simple concept that officially launched this weekend along with <A href="http://www.aspsoft.com/">the brand new ASPSOFT web site</A>. Stop by and check it out. If you have any comments on how we could improve it or just any general feedback, let us know. You can give it a try by locating my photo from my <A href="http://www.aspsoft.com/">ASPSOFT </A>email address of <A href="mailto:johnp@aspsoft.com">johnp@aspsoft.com</A>. </P> <P>&nbsp;</P><A HREF="/photos/jpapa/picture141794.aspx" target=_blank></A>
