These samples replace the samples that are linked from the MSDN docs in the CTP.&nbsp;One thing these samples lacked&nbsp;was the LINQ to Entities samples. Today,&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/charlie/archive/2007/03/11/101-linq-samples-code-updated.aspx">Charlie Calvert posted a link to updated samples</a> that include LINQ TO Entities samples inside the SamplesQueries example project. Inside the SamplesQueries project you will find a <strong>101 LINQ to Entities samples</strong>.</p><p>This is great news! Previously there were tons of examples in this project for LINQ to SQL, LINQ to XML, LINQ to Objects and LINQ to DataSets.
