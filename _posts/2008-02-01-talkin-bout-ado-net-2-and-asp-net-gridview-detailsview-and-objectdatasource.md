<P>As I mentioned in <A href="/blogs/john.papa/archive/2005/08/02/130144.aspx">a post</A> a few weeks back, I will be presenting a few topics at <A href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2005/or/">VSLive Orlando</A>. This past week I was sprucing up my code samples with the latest VS.NET 2005 release candidate and I was impressed with the little things in it. Some of the minor bugs were really paid attention to and the speed enhancements that were there in beta 2 are still there (yes, I was a bit worried that some of the DataSet improvements might be X'd out due to time or some funky reason). Anyway, I am really excited about presenting in Orlando because of the close timing to the release of VS.NET 2005. If you have been to any of my presentations in the past you'll know that I tend to use my slides as a talking point but that I prefer to show code examples to show how things work. I'm a visual guy :-) Anyway, I hope to see some of you there!</P> <P>Oh ... and I am almost confirmed for a trip out west to Las Vegas for a Academic conference. I don't have all the information yet but it appears to be a conference for the IT and IS professors of colleges and universities. I think it will be awesome to talk with the professors and see what they are teaching the next generation of code junkies like me. I am really looking forward to it.</P> <P>&nbsp;</P>
