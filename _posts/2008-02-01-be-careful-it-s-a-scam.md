<P><A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/toub/archive/2006/01/06/510099.aspx">It seems that somebody has a scam going</A> on where they send you&nbsp;<A href="http://toub.members.winisp.net/blogData/MsjScamMail.gif">this notice</A> in the mail (USPS mail) asking if you want to get MSJ magazine subscription. <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/toub/">Stephen Toub</A> at MSDN Magazine caught wind of this from a reader of MSDN Magazine and has stated this is a scam. OK, if you follow MSDN Magazine you probably already know that MSJ (Microsoft Systems Journal) no longer exists. It is one of the predecessors of MSDN Mag. Anyway, I suggest that if you get a <A href="http://toub.members.winisp.net/blogData/MsjScamMail.gif">notice</A> in the mail asking you to subscribe to MSJ <STRONG>do not send your money to these people</STRONG>. </P> <P>Thanks to <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/toub/">Stephen </A>and to the all the readers who caught wind of this scam for letting us all know.</P> <P>&nbsp;</P> <P>It seems <A href="http://www.computerworld.com/developmenttopics/development/story/0,10801,107629,00.html?SKC=development-107629">ComputerWorld </A>even followed up on this scam with <A href="http://www.computerworld.com/developmenttopics/development/story/0,10801,107629,00.html?SKC=development-107629">this article</A>.</P>
