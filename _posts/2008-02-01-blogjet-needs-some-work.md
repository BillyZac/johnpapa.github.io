<P>A while back I blogged about <A href="/blogs/john.papa/archive/2005/04/16/62098.aspx">my first impressions of BlogJet</A>. While I've been using <A href="http://blogjet.com/">BlogJet</A> on and off for a few&nbsp;months, I have unfortunatley put it back on my shelf. Don't get me wrong, it shows some real promise, but I had more issues with it not uploading images properly and sending some of my new posts into the netherworld. That is my biggest issue with BlogJet. I gave this a long hard look because I really wanted it to work. In any event, I will be sending some of my concerns to them as well as some of my future requests for features such as built in code formatting for code samples. (Currently I use a custom program I wrote as well as a program called <A href="http://www.jtleigh.com/CopySourceAsHtml/">CopySourceAsHtml</A>&nbsp;for formatting code.)</P> <P>For now I am using an HTML editor and good old copy and paste. </P> <P>NOTE: Brendan recently pointed out that it might be our server which is causing the uploading issues. So I apologize to the BlogJet software for any ill will :-) Seriously though, I still wish it had code formatting built in. How awesome would that be!</P> <P>&nbsp;</P>
