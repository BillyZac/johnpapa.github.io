<p>As of a few days ago, the SQL Server 2005 Everywhere Edition CTP is avaialble for download. This is the successor to SQL Server CE (aren&rsquo;t name changes great). You can <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=85e0c3ce-3fa1-453a-8ce9-af6ca20946c3&amp;displaylang=en">grab it here</a>. if you want some documentation, you can <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=E6BC81E8-175B-46EA-86A0-C9DACAA84C85&amp;displaylang=en">download the SQL Server 2005 Everywhere Edition Community Technology Preview Books Online</a> as well.</p> <p>Some pretty cool features have been added and some MSDN Magazine readers have reminded me that its about time I wrote another article on mobile devices and using SQL Server &hellip; I have a full slate of topics right now, but probably later this year.</p> <p>In the meantime, i&rsquo;ll be throwing my thoughts out on the topic on codebetter.com.</p>
