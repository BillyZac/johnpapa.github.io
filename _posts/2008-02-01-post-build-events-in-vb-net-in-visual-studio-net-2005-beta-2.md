<P>I was just poking around in <A href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/default.aspx">Visual Studio.NET 2005 Beta 2</A> and I noticed that in my VB.NET project there is now the option to create build events! This is a feature that I have used a lot in C# WinForm projects to copy my <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/entlib.asp">Enterprise Library</A> configuration files to the targe directory (release or debug). I am glad it is now available in VB.NET (at least in beta 2)!</P> <P>&nbsp;</P>
