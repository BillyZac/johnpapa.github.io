<P>Here is a short list of some of the more valauble (IMO) WinKey combinations. OK, there are more shortcut keys than the following, but these are some of the ones I use the most that involve the mysterious "Windows Key". WinKey + D is nice when my desktop just gets too cluttered. WinKey + E is great when I need to browse my file system. </P> <P><BR></P> <P> <TABLE border=1> <TBODY> <TR bgColor=silver> <TD>Shortcut</TD> <TD>Description</TD></TR> <TR> <TD>Windows Key + D</TD> <TD>Brings the desktop to the top of all other windows.</TD></TR> <TR> <TD>Windows Key + M</TD> <TD>Minimizes all windows.</TD></TR> <TR> <TD>Windows Key + E </TD> <TD>Open Microsoft Explorer. </TD></TR> <TR> <TD>Windows Key + Tab </TD> <TD>Cycle through open programs through the taskbar. </TD></TR> <TR> <TD>Windows Key + R </TD> <TD>Open the run window. </TD></TR> <TR> <TD>Windows Key + L </TD> <TD>Lock the computer (Windows XP and above only).</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P> <P>Any time I can keep my hands on the keyboard instead of flying back and forth from the keyboard to the mouse, its a win-win.</P> <P><BR></P>
