<p>A buddy of mine, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/wallym/">Wally McClure</a>, has a podcast called <a href="http://aspnetpodcast.com/CS11/blogs/asp.net_podcast/default.aspx">the ASP.NET Podcast</a> that he maintains and hosts. In <a href="http://aspnetpodcast.com/CS11/blogs/asp.net_podcast/archive/2006/07/21/349.aspx">this week&rsquo;s podcast</a>&nbsp;Wally <a href="http://aspnetpodcast.com/CS11/blogs/asp.net_podcast/archive/2006/07/21/349.aspx">chats with me </a>about data access and some other general ramblings. This reminded me of how horrible I sound in a recording.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
