<div class="Section1"><p class="MsoNormal">Let me start by saying that I have been working some crazy hours lately and I am battling a fierce springtime cold. OK, so there is my lame excuse &hellip;. I left my 2GB USB flash stick in my shirt pocket and threw it in the wash today. My wife just folded the laundry and brought the poor soul out to me to give me the bad news. Now this thing just went through the washing cycle and was inundated with water. It went through the drying cycle which gets so darn hot that I have had other plastics melt in it. Oddly enough the USB stick came out looking pretty good, (and much cleaner).</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">I put the stick in my computer hoping for the best &hellip;. and it still works! </p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">The moral of the story? Don&rsquo;t throw out those old USB keys because they are dirty, just throw them in the washing machine!</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
