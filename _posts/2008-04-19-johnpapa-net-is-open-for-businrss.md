<p>No that's not a typo in the title ... it's my poor attempt at dry humor :)</p> <p>I have had several questions from people over the past few months regarding my noticeable sparseness in blogging at <a href="http://www.codebetter.com">www.codebetter.com</a>, my blogging home for the past 3 years. The truth is that it took me a while to get back to setting up my new blogging home at <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net">www.johnpapa.net</a> . I used the various beta versions of <a href="http://www.graffiticms.com">Graffiti CMS</a> to get it started and then I recently migrated the site over to the release version of Graffiti. I must say that <a href="http://www.graffiticms.com">Graffiti</a> is perfect for my needs. I can consolidate my posts, organize my events, articles, and add some ASP.NET and SilverLight aspects, too. </p> <p>So what will you find on <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net">www.johnpapa.net</a> ? You will find my usual technical posts as well as a listing of all of the articles I have published (the books listing is not there yet) and all of the events I will be speaking at as they get scheduled and confirmed.</p> <p>Will I still post to <a href="http://www.CodeBetter.com">www.CodeBetter.com</a> ? Yes, I will still cross post some content to <a href="http://www.CodeBetter.com">www.CodeBetter.com</a> but the superset of the posts will be on <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net">www.johnpapa.net</a> including technical content, reviews, and opinions.</p> <p>So please add my new site <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net">www.johnpapa.net</a> to your aggregated feed&nbsp; list <a title="http://feeds.feedburner.com/JohnPapa" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/JohnPapa">http://feeds.feedburner.com/JohnPapa</a>.</p> <p>I'll be at <a href="/all/next-up-orlando-devconnections/">DevConnections</a> this coming week in Orlando, so if you are going to be around please stop by <a href="/all/next-up-orlando-devconnections/">one of my sessions on windows mobile development, LINQ, the Entity Framework or SQL Server Reporting Services</a> and say hi!</p>
