<p>This year for Valentine&rsquo;s Day I decided to try to replicate Hibachi steak. We are all pretty big on steak, including my daughters so it is an ideal meal when we can afford it. We cook steak and vegetables on the grill a lot using a home marinade we have come to prefer. But tonight it was time to attempt hibachi.</p>
<p>I searched around for several recipes and came up with what is a fairly simple recipe. Total cook time is about 15 minutes for the vegetables on medium heat and about 7 minutes for the steak on medium heat. First, start with the following portions (multiple as needed):</p>
<h5><strong>What you will need (serves 2):</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>12 inch pan for the steak</li>
<li>12 inch pan for the vegetables</li>
<li>16 oz steak&nbsp; (filet mignon or strip)</li>
<li>1/4 onion</li>
<li>1 green pepper</li>
<li>1 cup of mushrooms</li>
<li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
<li>1 tbsp butter</li>
<li>2 tsp garlic spread</li>
<li>3 tbsp soy sauce</li>
<li>1 tbsp sesame seeds</li>
<li>2 large, shallow pans or one large cookie sheet</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Cooking the Vegetables (15 minutes): </strong></h5>
<ol>
<li>Heat 1 12 inch pan on a medium flame</li>
<li>Cut the onions and green peppers into small bite sized pieces</li>
<li>Toss the onions, peppers and mushrooms in the pan</li>
<li>Add 1.5 tbsp soy sauce to vegetables and mix</li>
<li>Add 1 tbsp butter to vegetables and mix</li>
<li>Cook for 15 minutes on low to medium</li>
</ol>
<h5><strong>Searing the Steak (7 minutes): </strong></h5>
<ol>
<li>Heat 1 12 inch pan on a medium flame</li>
<li>Put 2 tbsp olive oil in the pan</li>
<li>Cut everything into bite-sized chunks</li>
<li>Once the pan is hot, put the steak on the pan (should sear)</li>
<li>Turn the steak pieces to sear all sides</li>
<li>After about 7 minutes (or when prepared the way you like) put 2 tsps of garlic spread into the pan</li>
<li>Add 1.5 tbsp of soy sauce and mix</li>
<li>Add 1 tbsp of sesame seeds and serve</li>
</ol>
<h5><strong>Keys:</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Stewing beef is easy &hellip; too easy. You can toss in a lot of great marinades and stew it all in the juices. If that is what you want, then great. But for this recipe the key is to sear the steak, not stew it. &lt;</li>
<li>Try not to overfill the pan with steak. If you make it for a family, try cooking it in waves based on the pan size. Make sure you have enough space for the meat to be seared.</li>
<li>Keep the meat cut into bite size pieces (or slightly larger). Do not put overly large pieces in the pan. This worked well for me since I have to cut all of my daughters&rsquo; steak anyway :)</li>
</ul>
