<P>Well, I finally did it. Today I joined the ranks of bloggers everywhere. I am grateful that the crew at codebetter.com was gracious enough to accept me into their community. Thanks guys!</P> <P>I'll be posting code samples, random thoughts, links, research and some personal musings in my blog ... that is, once I decide on the color schema and theme for it ;-). Well, I've got to get back to coloring Easter Eggs with my kids now. It's amazing how difficult it is to get that food coloring off of your clothes, skin and ... uh oh ... the dog!</P> <P> </P>
