They decided XP (the release being planned at that time) would be code named Whistler after one of the local ski areas, and the "next" version of Windows ten or so years down the line would be called Blackcomb after the ski area on the next mountain. An interim "dot" release was expected, and it would be named Longhorn after the bar in which they were drinking (and which happens to be half-way between the two mountains).</SPAN></FONT></P> <P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"></SPAN></FONT>&nbsp;</P> <P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial color=#000000 size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Blackcomb was long ago dropped as a code name, though it still pops up from time to time. My take is that it remains for some folks a convenient name for "stuff to do in a release down the road."</SPAN></FONT></P> <P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"></SPAN></FONT>&nbsp;</P> <P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial color=#000000 size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Prior to Windows ME (confusingly code named Millennium, which was its actual name), Windows division used the name of the city in which the OS was announced as the code name.</SPAN></FONT></P> <P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"></SPAN></FONT>&nbsp;</P> <P class=MsoNormal><FONT color=#000000><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">eHome division has maintained the Whistler/Blackcomb theme by code naming its </SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">release after specific ski runs on the mountain.
