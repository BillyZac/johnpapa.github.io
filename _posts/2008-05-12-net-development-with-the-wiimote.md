<p>My friend and colleague <a href="http://www.brianpeek.com/">Brian Peek</a> has been developing some awesome and fun applications for a while. As a contributing author to MSDN's Coding 4 Fun Bran has been creating some cool applications that you should really check out at his site at <a href="http://www.brianpeek.com">www.brianpeek.com</a>. </p> <p>Not his latest, but certainly one of his most famous, achievement is his <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/coding4fun/archive/2007/03/14/1879033.aspx">Wiimote .NET Library</a> and the uses that he is putting it to. Brian got the attention of Newsweek magazine for the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/coding4fun/archive/2007/03/14/1879033.aspx">Wiimote .NET library</a> that he authored. They interviewed him and the article can be found on line at <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/136381">http://www.newsweek.com/id/136381</a>.&nbsp; The print article should be in the May 19th issue of the International Edition of Newsweek.</p>
