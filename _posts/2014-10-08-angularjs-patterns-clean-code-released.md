<p>I'm happy to announce that my <a href="http://jpapa.me/ngclean">newest course is now available at Pluralsight. AngularJS Patterns: Clean Code</a> is a melding of patterns, tips and what I call "readable code" all rolled into one. I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it!</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Once you learn the basics of AngularJS, you encounter decisions that not only affect how well your app will scale and perform, but also how easily it can be maintained. This course takes AngularJS developers beyond the fundamentals to address that next level of problems you encounter. You'll see familiar patterns such as Separation of Concerns (SoC) are at the heart of building solid AngularJS applications. You'll learn techniques to organize code and the right questions to ask yourself that can shape your application patterns.</p>

<p>Other topics include: how to extend application design from small, to medium, to large scale apps with many modules, naming conventions, controller techniques, reusable services, creating reusable building blocks, dependency injection, and build automation. By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of how to write clean code with AngularJS to create greater implicit readability, make it easier to maintain, and extendable.</p>
