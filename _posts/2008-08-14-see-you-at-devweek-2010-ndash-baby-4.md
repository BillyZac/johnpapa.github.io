<p>2009 was the year I was finally going to make it to London for <a href="http://www.devweek.com/">DevWeek</a>. I have been to conferences in Europe but oddly never to London. It seems each time it came up there was something I already had scheduled. So this year looked promising. I submitted a ton of topics and I was excited to finally go to London. Then I received some great news … my wife and I are having another baby! The baby is due in March of 2009 … so as much as I’d like to go to DevWeek I had to bow out for 2009. I can’t be out of the country a week or so after my baby is born. My wife was actually OK with it, but its too much for one person to handle with 4 kids. The good news is that the schedule was not set yet so there is no harm done.</p>  <p>I hear DevWeek is a great conference and I plan on submitting&#160; for the next event they hold in London. Ironically, this happened one other time too when we had our 3rd child in March a few years ago.Sometimes its just not in the cards :) I’ll get there … eventually!</p>  <p>Here is our first ultrasound of baby #4. We have 3 girls so we’re betting on another girl. As long as s/he is healthy, we’ll be thrilled! Now, we just need to pick a name.</p>  <p><a href="http://7papa7.com/FloridaLife/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/Andbabymakes.6_101D1/Baby_4_b5811a9e-dcc0-4b22-ac3f-9b0e3a0cfcbe.jpg"><img height="320" alt="Baby#4" src="http://7papa7.com/FloridaLife/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/Andbabymakes.6_101D1/Baby_4_thumb_09fcf686-071c-4ed2-ac84-4b0228003405.jpg" width="414" border="0" /></a></p><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/kick/?url=/all/see-you-at-devweek-2010-ndash-baby-4/"><img src="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/Services/Images/KickItImageGenerator.ashx?url=/all/see-you-at-devweek-2010-ndash-baby-4/&amp;bgcolor=0080C0&amp;fgcolor=FFFFFF&amp;border=000000&amp;cbgcolor=D4E1ED&amp;cfgcolor=000000" alt="DotNetKicks Image" border="0/"></a></div><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_url = '/all/see-you-at-devweek-2010-ndash-baby-4/';</script><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_title = 'See You at DevWeek 2010 – Baby #4!';</script><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_blurb = 'See You at DevWeek 2010 – Baby #4!';</script><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_style = '1';</script><script language="javascript" src="http://widgets.dzone.com/widgets/zoneit.js"></script> </div>
