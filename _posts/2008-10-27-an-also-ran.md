<p>In an article yesterday, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget</a> labeled <a href="/tags/silverlight/">Silverlight</a> as an also ran. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/10/26/netflix-finally-brings-watch-instantly-to-macs-via-silverlight/">The article is about how Netflix has announced it will use Silverlight to stream movies to the Mac</a>. Very cool indeed.&#160; just got a kick out of this line from the article:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>In a move that seemed like it would never, ever, <em>ever</em> happen, Netflix has finally managed to bring its streaming video technology (and decent library) to Macs everywhere, <strong>thanks to Microsoft's Flash-esque also-ran, Silverlight.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>Now, I can understand that people don;t like Silverlight or may choose Flash over it. But to be an also-ran don’t you have to be in the race for a certain period of time? Otherwise aren’t you the new candidate, or the up and comer, or the underdog? </p>  <p>Totally tongue in cheek here … but I find it interesting how people think about <a href="/tags/silverlight/">Silverlight</a>.</p>
