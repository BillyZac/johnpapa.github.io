We’ll cover how to create and lay out a user interface using XAML, and examine the rich control set for building applications. Then we’ll look at coding with C# and Visual Basic, as well as the cool things you can do without writing code using features like behaviors and data binding. Finally we’ll look at how to continue your learning with an orientation to the numerous resources available today for learning more Silverlight.       <br /></p>    <p><strong>Session Two – Empowering Line of Business (LOB) Applications on Windows        <br /></strong>Line of Business Applications (LOB) are all about adding value to the business and helping it run at full capacity. In this session you will learn how to take LOBs to the next level. We will discuss full trust, out of browser scenarios, SharePoint integration, RIA Services and more. We will also discuss the basics of the MVVM pattern that will simplify the way you develop applications today. After this session you will have all the tools you need to make your Line of business applications stand out on Windows.       <br /></p>    <p><strong>Session Three – Creating Interactive Windows applications using Media and Touch        <br /></strong>You’re a developer, not a designer, but in recent years the media side of development is getting more intense. How can you keep up? A basic understanding of Expression Blend, Silverlight 4 and Microsoft Pivot, which you’ll have by the end of this session, will get you farther along this path than you thought possible. Start leveraging the power of Multi-Touch, Video and Data Visualization to create engaging experiences that will light up on Windows.       <br /></p>    <p><strong>Session Four - Building RAD Silverlight Applications using LightSwitch        <br /></strong>Visual Studio LightSwitch is a new development tool (currently in beta) for building business applications. LightSwitch simplifies the development process, letting you concentrate on the business logic and doing much of the remaining work for you. By using LightSwitch, an application can be designed, built, tested, and in your user’s hands quickly. Come explore LightSwitch for forms-over-data applications in a rapid application development fashion.       <br /></p>    <p><strong>Session Five - Light up your Silverlight Apps for Win7 using Native Extensions        <br /></strong>Learn about a new toolkit called Native Extensions for Silverlight (NESL) , which provides Silverlight friendly hooks to a number of native Windows 7 features you can use in your Silverlight applications. The libraries make it significantly easier to leverage Windows 7 from Silverlight. The libs also help with lighting up a Silverlight application with a minimum of effort for Windows 7 with items like jumplists and icon overlays. Learn “how-to” with special rigging-it-up sessions on video capture, speech, and Win7 features like jump lists, icon overlays, taskbar progress and more!       <br /></p>    <p><strong>Session Six – Silverlight Futures        <br /></strong>This session will highlight the compelling features coming in Silverlight 5. With tighter integration with Windows APIs, full trust operations, XA
ML debugging, and support for a 64 bit browsers, you’ll see how Silverlight continues to be the dominating platform for building rich Internet and Windows applications.</p></blockquote>
