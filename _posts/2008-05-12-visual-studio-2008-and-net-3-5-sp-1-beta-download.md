<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2008/05/12/visual-studio-2008-and-net-fx-3-5-sp1-beta-available-now.aspx">Soma</a> announced this morning that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2008/05/12/visual-studio-2008-and-net-fx-3-5-sp1-beta-available-now.aspx">Visual Studio 2008 and .NET 3.5 SP 1 is now ready and can be downloaded</a>. This includes several updates, includes support for SQL Server 2008, and has a few new products including the Entity Framework, LINQ to Entities and ADO.NET Data Services (aka Astoria). <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/05/12/visual-studio-2008-and-net-framework-3-5-service-pack-1-beta.aspx">ScottGu posted some notes</a> regarding what's included in the service pack, as well.</p> <p>Of course all of this is released 2 days before I have a demonstration on the Entity Framework and LINQ to Entities on Wednesday to the Sarasota .NET and SQL Server User groups. So I have a few modifications to make for my presentations.</p> <p>I received an error when I first tried to install it. The problem was that the service pack was in conflict with Silverlight Tools Beta for Visual Studio 2008 which I was using to create/edit Silverlight 2 applications. Once uninstalling this i was able to get the service pack to install properly. Scott Gu's post discusses this issue as well as the importance of making sure you install Vista SP 1 first.</p> <p>Check out <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/05/12/visual-studio-2008-and-net-framework-3-5-service-pack-1-beta.aspx">ScottGu's post</a> for full details.</p>
