<P>Congratulations to <A HREF="/blogs/geoff.appleby">Geoff</A> for getting his MVP award today. I also owe a great big thanks to&nbsp;those who nominated me and&nbsp;a thanks to the MVP&nbsp;team for awarding me with the MVP award. I was notified earlier today that I am now an MVP for Visual Developer - Visual C#. Yes its just a status, but its pretty cool to be nominated and I am personally touched that some of you nameless few out there nominated me for the award. </P> <P>Anyway, that's enough self indulgence for the day for me :-)</P> <P>Oh ... I guess I can talk&nbsp;smack to Sahil now that we are both MVP's. :-) </P> <P>&nbsp;</P>
