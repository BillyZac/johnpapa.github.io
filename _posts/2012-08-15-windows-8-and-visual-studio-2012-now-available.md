<p>Are you ready? Both Visual Studio 2012 and Windows 8 RTM today for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com">MSDN and TechNet subscribers. And they are available for download now</a>! </p> <p>A word of caution … I had to go to the details list and search for both for them to appear (they did not show up in the home page for downloads for me). I’ve been using Windows 8 and VS 2012 (public) pre-releases for a while now and they are very solid and fast. </p> <p>For those interested in Win8 … I grabbed these snippets of dates from <a href="http://windowsteamblog.com/windows/b/bloggingwindows/archive/2012/08/01/windows-8-has-reached-the-rtm-milestone.aspx">the Windows blog post</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; August 15th: Developers will be able to download the final version of Windows 8 via your MSDN subscriptions.<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; August 15th: IT professionals testing Windows 8 in organizations will be able to access the final version of Windows 8 through your TechNet subscriptions.<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; September 1st: Volume License customers without Software Assurance will be able to purchase Windows 8 through Microsoft Volume License Resellers.</p> <p><img alt="Start_Default_RTM_3ROW" src="http://windowsteamblog.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Blogs-Components-WeblogFiles/00-00-00-59-23-metablogapi/8688.Start_5F00_Default_5F00_RTM_5F00_3ROW_5F00_thumb_5F00_4D391858.png"></p></blockquote>
