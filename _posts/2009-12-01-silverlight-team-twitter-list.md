<p>Last week <a href="/silverlight/silverlight-mvp-list-on-twitter/">I wrote about the new Silverlight MVP Twitter list I created</a> to make it easier to follow all of the Silverlight MVPs and the evangelists. You can follow the entire group using this link: <a href="http://www.twitter.com/john_papa/SilverlightMVP">www.twitter.com/john_papa/SilverlightMVP</a>&#160; </p>  <p>I also <a href="http://twitter.com/John_Papa/msftsilverlight">created a Twitter list containing several of the Microsoft Silverlight product team</a>. This list includes members of the Silverlight product team, RIA Services, evangelists, MEF, and other Silverlight “must follows” at Microsoft who are involved in Silverlight. The list is still growing!</p>  <p>So please follow this list and check back as I will be adding more as I gather them.</p>  <p><a title="http://twitter.com/John_Papa/msftsilverlight" href="http://twitter.com/John_Papa/msftsilverlight">http://twitter.com/John_Papa/msftsilverlight</a></p>
