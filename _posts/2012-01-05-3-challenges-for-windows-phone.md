<p>I like my Windows Phone. The UI is awesome and I’m itching to get the Lumia 900 when it comes out. The iPhone interface feels a bit dated to me. But the lack of good apps is killing me right now. I have faith in the Windows Phone team though that 2012 will be a big year and they’ll continue to rise. </p> <p>Here is an article I wrote for VS Magazine that states what I deem as the 3 challenges WP faces today. The key is to forget the developers who write code for it and go talk to users … real people. Most hardly know what it is. Sigh. <a href="http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2012/01/01/microsoft-phone-challenges.aspx">http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2012/01/01/microsoft-phone-challenges.aspx</a></p>
