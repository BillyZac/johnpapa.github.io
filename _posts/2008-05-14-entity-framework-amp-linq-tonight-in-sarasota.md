<p>Tonight I will be joining the <a href="http://sarasotasql.net/">Sarasota SQL Server User group</a> and the <a href="http://www.sarasotadev.net/">Sarasota .NET User group</a> at their combined May 2008 meeting. I will be presenting the Entity Framework and LINQ using the new bits that came out 2 days ago on Monday including the new features that it brings. I always have a good time at user groups and especially so when its a hot topic like the Entity Framework and LINQ. </p> <p>I'll be showing several demonstrations using the Entity Framework that demonstrate how to use it in different scenarios and its future direction. I'm looking forward it!</p> <p>Here is the logistical information for tonight's event and Here is link to a <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rlz=1T4GGIH_en__265__265&amp;q=2635+Fruitville+Rd,+Sarasota,+FL+34237,+USA&amp;um=1&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=title">google map</a> for directions.</p> <hr>  <p><img alt="" src="https://www.clicktoattend.com/images/partners/5125c0dc-4f57-48bb-b86a-ee0cd8023c42.jpg" border="0"> <p>5/14/2008 @ 6:00 PM - 7:30 PM <p>Welcome Time:<br>5/14/2008 5:45 PM Eastern Time <p><strong>Location:</strong> <p>The Community Foundation of Sarasota County <p>2635 Fruitville Road <p>Sarasota, FL 34237
