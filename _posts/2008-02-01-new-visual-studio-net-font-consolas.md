<DIV class=postText> <P>I found this post from <A href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/cdistilled/archive/2006/05/27/97221.aspx">Doug Holland </A>earlier today regarding his coming across the new <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=22e69ae4-7e40-4807-8a86-b3d36fab68d3&amp;displaylang=en">Consolas </A>font. Its a new font that Microsoft now provides which installs itself as the default font within Visual Studio 2005.</P> <P><FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>:</FONT> "Sean Laberee within the <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vseditor">Visual Studio Editor's blog</A>, cautions that the Consolas font will only look good if you have ClearType enabled. Using the Appearance Tab of the&nbsp;Display applet within the Windows&nbsp;Control Panel you need to ensure that the check box "Use the following method to smooth edges of screen fonts" is checked and that it is set to Clear Type." ... from Doug's blog.</P> <P>You can <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=22e69ae4-7e40-4807-8a86-b3d36fab68d3&amp;displaylang=en">download the new font here</A>.</P></DIV>
