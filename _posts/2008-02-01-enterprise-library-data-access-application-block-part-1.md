<P>The <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/07/default.aspx">July 2005 issue of MSDN Magazine</A> is now available online. The amount of discussion that has surrounded the Enterprise Library and its Application Blocks (good, bad and indifferent) has been tremendous. I decided to create a 3 part series that explores the Enterprise Library Data Access blocks <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/07/DataPoints/default.aspx">in my Data Points column</A>. In this issue I discuss how how the Enterprise Library DAAB fits into an architecture as well as some best practices in using the block. I review the Enterprise Library model and dive right into the DAAB and its configuration and cryptography features, when and where the DAAB can be used, and lots more. </P> <P>There is a lot to review with Ent Lib and onyl so much fits into an article, so I decided to split this up into a 3 parter. In the upcoming Part 2 and Part 3 I explore how post build events can be used to ease the use of configuration files, several ways of retreiving data, saving data, transactions with Ent Lib, using NUnit with&nbsp;Ent Lib, and its factory model.</P> <P>&nbsp;</P><A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/07/default.aspx"><IMG src="/photos/jpapa/images/64573/original.aspx" border=0></A>
