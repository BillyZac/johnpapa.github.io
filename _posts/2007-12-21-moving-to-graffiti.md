<p>Today I started the migration of my web site and blog to <a href="http://www.telligent.com">Telligent's</a> new tool, <a href="http://www.graffiticms.com">Graffiti</a>. You can check out the latest news on Graffiti at www.graffiticms.com . It is currently in beta, but has some very interesting features. I am sure to go through some growing pains with it as its full release version is due to come out in January&nbsp; 2008, but so far it has been pretty smooth. </p> <p>I took a theme that <a href="www.richmercer.com">Rich Mercer</a> created and I tweaked it a bit. He wrote the stylized theme of which I changed some of the styles, images and colors just a wee bit. The result of those change are what you see here on this site.</p> <p>There is not a lot of information around on how to customize Graffiti yet, although I expect a lot will be as times moves on. That is the bad news. But the good news is that it is very simple and QUICK to get up and running. I added a few customizations to the site including some static pages in the navigation bar as well. I found a <a href="http://richmercer.com/blog/customizing-a-post-layout-in-graffiti/">few posts on Rich's site that point out how to do this</a>.</p> <p>So now I have to migrate all of my posts from <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/john.papa/default.aspx">CodeBetter.com</a> over to my site on Graffiti. Jayme <a href="http://ndepth.net/blog/graffiti-migrator/">Davis has put together a migration tool</a> to do just that. I plan on giving that a try this weekend.</p> <p>So please bear with the process. I expect that I will be making a lot of changes over the next month until everything is hooked up and ready to go. I will be cross posting to both CodeBetter.com and <a href="/">johnpapa.net</a></p>
