<p>Quick callout to my colleague and evangelist Yochay Kiriaty, who posted a great set of learning materials and labs for <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/learn/courses/WP7TrainingKit/">Windows Phone 7 on Channel 9</a>. That’s right … Channel 9! There are several great labs that are really cool that you can try out online or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=2338b5d1-79d8-46af-b828-380b0f854203&amp;displaylang=en">download the offline kit</a>. One of the labs is the Hello Phone lab which is a puzzle app for Windows Phone 7.</p>  <p><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/learn/courses/WP7TrainingKit/"><img title="new4" border="0" alt="new4" src="http://windowsteamblog.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/wpdev/new4_5F00_thumb_5F00_3AA60EEB.png" width="234" height="386" /></a></p>
