If you visited it early on you might have missed the comment from the edtitor which reads:</P> <P mce_keep="true"><FONT color=red>[<B> Editor's Update - 6/19/2007: </B>The ADO.NET Entity Framework and Tools will ship during the first half of 2008 as an update to the Visual Studio 2008 release.] </FONT></P> <P mce_keep="true"><SPAN class=clsRed>We were told the tools would ship later, so this just confirms the plans for the EF and its tools to be available next year. I'll be chomping at the bit to use it and giving as much feedback as I can to the team as I can. They seem dedicated to making a great product that we can use in DDD.</SPAN></P> <P mce_keep="true"><SPAN class=clsRed></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
