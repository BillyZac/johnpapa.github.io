<P>I've been asked for some T-SQL and XML code samples that I have presented of late. Here are some sample snippets of code that you can use to examine some of the SQL 2005 T-SQL features and its XML features, as well. The code is in a zip file below this post.</P> <P>All code is "as-is" ... no warranty :)</P> <P>Enjoy!</P>
