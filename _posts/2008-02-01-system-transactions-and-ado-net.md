<P>I had a good time at the <A href="http://www.tvug.net/">Tech Valley .NET User's Group</A> meeting last night. I presented some slides and code examples showing the new features of ADO.NET 2 as well as a demo of System.Transactions. It was a small but knowledgable group of people and I enjoyed meeting with them. Scott Stewart <A href="http://www.dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/sstewart/archive/2005/11/09/133651.aspx">gives his opinion on what he got out of the meeting at his blog</A>.</P> <P>System.Transactions is just so cool for so many reasons. I think my favorite is in how easy it is to add transactional support at a low level that includes nesting support. There was a huge gap in&nbsp;development prior to System.Transactions in how transactions were implemented. It is a huge leap forward over options such as Enterprise Services, transactions at the DB level and ADO.NET transactions. I could go on and on, and probably will soon :-) </P> <P>Right now I am working on revising <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/02/DataPoints/">my previous article on System.Transactions </A>that I wrote for <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag">MSDN Magazine</A> with the Beta&nbsp;1 version of VS.NET 2005. There have been some great improvements made to it since then that are very worth talking about. Until then ...</P> <P>&nbsp;</P> <P>&nbsp;</P>
