<p>Hey John,</p>

<p>If you weren’t already aware, DevLink was retired this year leaving a strong need for a technical conference in Middle Tennessee. While we only had a few months to plan, we decided to dive in and create a new conference in Nashville on August 29th named Music City Code.</p>

<p>Would you have any interest in giving a Saturday afternoon keynote at a Nashville conference?</p>

<p>I know this is terribly late notice and we’re starting off fairly small this year, but it doesn’t hurt to ask and thought you might be interested in taking a trip to Nashville on our dime. :)</p>

<p>Cheers!
Gaines
