<p>Hello,</p>

<p>Thanks for your blogpost http://www.johnpapa.net/tips-for-running-node-and-npm-on-windows/ :) and sorry to disturb you for that.</p>

<p>I have a problem with tips dor running node and npm on windows.</p>

<p>My system : 
- Windows 10 Pro
(chocolatey install)
- Nodejs v0.12.7
- Python2 v2.7.10 (I have tested with 2.7.2)
- Visual Studio 2015 Community</p>

<p>But when install for example BrowserSync, i have more error. Node proposed to rebuild node-gyp but i have More Error ?</p>

<p>Did you have a solution about that ? Because i see in your blog you proposed to install Visual Studio 2015.</p>

<p>Thanks by advance for your help
Have a good day
Guy-Philippe
