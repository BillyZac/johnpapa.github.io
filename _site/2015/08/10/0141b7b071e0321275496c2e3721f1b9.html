<p>Hi John,
I have a question regarding ngInclude,
there are a lot of posts regarding how to run code after all includes are done. 
I would like to ask your opinion, I did using a run block with $timeout(myFunction), however it doesn’t looks the right way.
I saw other guys doing by directives or by counting &amp; registering listeners to the $includeContentLoaded.</p>

<p>What do you suggest, if possible, could you create an entry for this on your styleguide?</p>

<p>thank you, and have a nice day ahead.
