<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I have been looking at some of your courses on Pluralsight, fantastic stuff!  I was wondering if you are aware of any courses that go over web api, ef &amp; repositories, but from the DB First aspect.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge, it is greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Simon.
