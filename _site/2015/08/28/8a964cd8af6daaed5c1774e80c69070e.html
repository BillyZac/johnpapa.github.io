<p>Hello John,
Sorry to bother you, as I guess you are a very busy person. Please I would need your input on the following points below</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; I bumped into BreezeJs and was considering inculcating it into our project. Can you advice when it’s best fit and when not. I often view you github repo and you often use this library in most his samples.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Please, i am working on restructuring our AngularJS project properly (definitely using by feature) as the App is growing bigger. My concern is how to easily identify the features. From your repo (https://github.com/johnpapa/ng-demos/tree/master/cc-bmean/src/client/app), I realize features cuts across a whole lot’s of things from business objects like session to html related stuff like layout. My guess is, features identified based on the “Nouns” in an app (Sort of identify Classes in OOP)</p>

<p>Thanks very much for taking time to read this email and looking forward to hearing from you soon.</p>

<p>Regards
