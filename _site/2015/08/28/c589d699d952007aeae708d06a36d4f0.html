<p>Hi John! Right now I’m using knockoutJS a lot and I want to give a try to AngularJS, but I don’t know how to accomplish this. What I want to do is something like the ko.mapping from knockout. How can I add ‘observables’ and methods to a model that comes from a JSON in angular? Thank you and good job!
