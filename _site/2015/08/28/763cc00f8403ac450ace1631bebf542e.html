<p>hi sir,</p>

<p>first let me thank you for angular-styleguide it helped me so much on my work
and it helped me understand angularjs further.</p>

<p>i created a generator based from your styleguide, still working on it though.
i just want to ask your opinion or suggestion about it.</p>

<p>right now i just simply spinned up a repository more like as a proof of concept.
if you have time please check it out</p>

alex
