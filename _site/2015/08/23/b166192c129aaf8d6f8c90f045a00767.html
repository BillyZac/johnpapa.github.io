<p>John,</p>

<p>I will get right to the point.  I want to pay you to help me.  I am not trying to sell you something.</p>

<p>Our company provides a business intelligence product to the mortgage industry.  I am one of the owners and the Chief Architect.  We are a .net shop and are moving the UI to Angular.  I have been reading some articles that you have published and I found your Angular Style Guide on GitHub (which I really liked).</p>

<p>My request:  We need your help getting started with Angular and I am looking for a mentor of sorts.  I know you have done consulting work in the past, I just don’t know if you do now.  As we build our first apps in Angular I need some guidance or even an editor.  I write the book, you tell me why it sucks and how I should correct it.  If that does not appeal to you, please tell me what would.</p>

<p>Hope to hear from you soon.  Take care.</p>
