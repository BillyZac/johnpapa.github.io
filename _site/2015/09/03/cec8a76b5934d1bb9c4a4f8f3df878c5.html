<p>I can see why but to just stop the comments box on Triond outside facebook is mad and not giveing choice, i do not want people who can track me because of my job finding out information about me on an open site like facebook, so please think again it is not good for all but to have a multi choice comments box asking how to share your comments would be better if facebook has to be involved.
