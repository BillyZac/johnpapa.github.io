<p>Hi john
thank you for your work (generator-hottowel, Angular Style Guide, pluralsight courses),</p>

<p>I have a problem when I run gulp serve-dev (hottowel) in in c9.io.</p>

<p>I find this http://stackoverflow.com/a/29926723/2310786 but I don’t see how to do it with the hottowel.</p>

<p>thank you.
