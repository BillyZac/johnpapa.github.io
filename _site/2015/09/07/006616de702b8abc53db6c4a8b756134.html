<p>Dear master John: I’m in love with Hottowel Angular Genrerator and applying it in all projects from the company I’m working for. 
I think you’re the unique person in the world that can solve me a doubt. 
I need to use the Hottowel only for the /admin of my website. So, do you recommend I use the hottowel also for the front of my website by adding some routes, “/” for the website instead current dashboard and /admin to launch the Hottowel shell, or by separating both in different folder structures and technologies? My desire is work with Laravel 5, and integrating Angular is so easy, but not with Gulp and being able to serve-dev Hottowel served by Laravel server instead of Node. With Laravel, the website could be a non SPA, and the admin could routed to Hottowel, but gulp it would be very hard, so I’m getting crazy looking the best solution. Thank you very very much! Best regards.
