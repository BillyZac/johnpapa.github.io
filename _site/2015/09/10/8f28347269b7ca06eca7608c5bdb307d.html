<p>I would like your help in multiple ways: 
1) I want your opinion on my business project, 
2) I want you to help me build the site or raise funds to build the site, 
3) I want you to pray with me for solutions, 
and
4) I want you to help me to find 4 good, highly motivated and skilled people who do business righteously (win-win satisfaction guaranteed) to join PICISI in admin roles.</p>

<p>I ask these specific things of you because I believe you have the resources to help me, in ways that all of my marketing, fundraising, and outreach efforts have failed to accomplish so far.</p>

<p>Here is some more info:<br />

PICISI crowdfunding via cryptocurrency -  https://nxtforum.org/monetary-system-153/(ann)-picisi’s-token-pi(numus)-launched-on-august-27/msg192406/#msg192406
PICISI cryptocurrency - https://nxtportal.org/currencies/1350076970661039300</p>

<p>We want to create the go-to place for inventors, entrepreneurs, and ‘idea people’ to do what they do to make our world a better place for good people.  There are many great minds and/or skills people who have the talents to make our world a better place but never had a meaningful opportunity to realize their potential. With the global outreach potential of the internet combined with the funding potential of crowdfunding and cryptocurrency we’re excited at the prospect of seeing greatness achieved by very many people in our lifetime as a direct result of what PICISI can so.</p>

<p>Please help us in anyway you see fit.</p>

<p>Thanks
PICISI
