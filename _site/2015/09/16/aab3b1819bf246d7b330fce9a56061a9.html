<p>Good afternoon John,</p>

<p>You and I met several months back at the code camp in Orlando, FL and I was talking to my VP about that session. We’re in the process of starting to use Angular as our client side Mv* framework and he was wondering what your rates would be to have you do an on-site training session for a group of about 8 of us. We’d really like to get off on the right foot with this.</p>

<p>Best regards,
David Folger
