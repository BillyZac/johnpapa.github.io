<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I have been studing all this month your HotTowel framework in Pluralsight (single-page-apps-jumpstart first and after build-apps-angular-breeze-part2).</p>

<p>What HoTTowel exercice example do you recommend me to use as base for a very huge project? I would value: updated libraries (breeze, bootstrap, etc..) and funcionallity.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for you time and your work,</p>

<p>Rubén P.
