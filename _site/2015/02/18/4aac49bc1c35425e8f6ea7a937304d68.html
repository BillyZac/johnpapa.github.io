<p>Hi John</p>

<p>I’m a follower of yours and i made a typescript implementation of your hottowel projects for angular and durandal.</p>

<p>From my point of view there are a lot of people not really getting how to use typescript, that is why i made this implementation to give some guidance for those who are new in this area. Because TypeScript is not only about typing it’s also about engineering and object oriented programming paradigms which are in most typescript solutions i see lost, which is quite disappointing.</p>

<p>I guess you are quite busy ;) anyhow i would be really glad if you could give some comment to it.</p>

<p>You can find the solution on github:
https://github.com/rdnscr/2learn</p>

<p>Regards
Raphael
