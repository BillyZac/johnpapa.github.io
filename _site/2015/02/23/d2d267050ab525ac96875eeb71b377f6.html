<p>John,</p>

<p>I’ve been working through your Pluralsight courses on SPA with HotTowel and CC (Angular/Breeze), updating with the latest components. All works well, and I’ve learned a lot debugging updates (and my typos) along the way. Excellent work!</p>

<p>I’ve been trying to open up a second datacontext using an entity manager with a metadatstore that is not camel case (but pass through). Got it working pre-repository pattern by using 2 entity managers within the same datacontext… a poor hack.</p>

<p>Can you provide a simple example of implementing a second datacontext (that doesn’t use camel case, but uses the breeze default naming convention for the store) in the post repository refactored state of cc angular/breeze ? the main issue is the breeze naming convention.</p>

<p>Maybe I took a wrong turn on this and Breeze doc has the answer, it’s just not clear(to me)  on how to implement multiple data-contexts (when not using the same naming convention), with your repository implementation.</p>

<p>Remember the config.route Prime method … Here was my config.route attempt. I also have a second model.corpods with it’s own extensions and configureMetadataStore method.</p>

<pre><code>//Customized to prime multiple Data Contexts for every route once
prime.$inject = ['$q', 'datacontext', 'datacontext.corpods'];
function prime($q, codecamper, corpods) {
    return $q.all([
        codecamper.prime(),
        corpods.prime()
    ]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note: if multiple data contexts is addressed and resolved in the final code for the course, just point me to that.  I’ve been avoiding reviewing the final result in detail to follow along through your refactoring process.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>
