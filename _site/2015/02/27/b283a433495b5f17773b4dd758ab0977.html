<p>hi John,</p>

<p>First of all Thanks 4 your sharing/transfer knowledge and also to this excellent blog. (love it)</p>

<p>Second, i want to ask u something (i think interesting) related to ES6, arrow function.
i note that arrow function cannot create an function declaration, just an expression function.</p>

<p>so i see in your angularjs “bible”(:)) Style guide that u use a lot in function declaration because u want to put the “API return object” at top of the file(module) and after that declare all the functions. (There is the hoisted problem that u mentioned in your style guide)</p>

<p>The Q: how u will do that with arrow function? (do u must still use the ES5 syntax for that)? BTW i ask related the ES5. because if i move to ES6 i want that all my current function will do it with arrow function with the same syntax.</p>

<p>General Thought : If we use the arrow function, it can be very problematic with the hoisted issue in general(the angularJS style guide function order is just one example), what do u think?</p>

<p>Thanks a lot,
Chen.R
