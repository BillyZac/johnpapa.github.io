<p>Hi John</p>

<p>My name is Daniel Mettler, I’m a developer / many-other-things and probably one of the most active bloggers on DNN, one of the most used CMSs on the .net stack. My team and I contribute a lot to the OS-community with a special plugin (called 2sxc) and lots of technical and design-oriented posts.</p>

<p>DNN has a special history (originally VB, built on IBuySpy etc.) but it’s slowly progressing to more modern concepts (C#, WebApi, etc.). One of the weaknesses is that many developers have a hobby background and think they know what they’re doing without any knowledge of software-architecture and things like that. So when new technologies come (from the bad guys from Google or PHP) or even well architected solutions like WebAPI, the adoption is slow. This means that to convince people to even try something new, I have to deliver a well crafted, simple solution and lots of documentation - and then people will try it and adapt it to their needs.</p>

<p>I’ve been trying to motivate people to use AngularJS with DNN but realize that whatever I publish, it will usually be used as a template without much thinking - so it has to be pretty perfect because anything I do incorrectly will be duplicated by many.</p>

<p>So I’m working on this sample app and blogs I’ll write, which should help many get started. It’s basically a feedback form and a simple admin-tool to manage the feedback. Even though it’s super trivial, I’m trying to adhere to as many best practices as possible and referencing them in my code to provide a learning experience to all that build on it.</p>

<p>Though the App is very simple, I would appreciate some help from you - probably 2-3 hours of your time. My main concerns are:
	1. Am I adhering to the relevant best practices in my sample app?
	2. Various small issues I’m experiencing around the fact that a CMS is not an SPA environment but more a Multiple-Apps-per-Page kind of system, which causes some issues I would love to solve elegantly, so the other developers don’t need to worry about it.</p>

<p>What’s in it for you? Well mostly fame/recognition - the thing we all live off :). In my code and blogs I’ll mention you and your work regularly, link to as many best practices that apply etc.</p>

<p>So: could you help me on this? I believe it would contribute an important boost to the DNN open-source community - and the better the initial work is, the more others will benefit.</p>

<p>Hoping to hear from you soon,
Daniel
