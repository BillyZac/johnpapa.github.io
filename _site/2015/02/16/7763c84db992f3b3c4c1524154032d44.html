<p>I began with a project to resurrect Silverlight a few years ago, Fayde (http://fayde.io).  I began building the engine in pure Javascript rendering to the canvas.  As the prototype turned into a legitimate solution, I realized the potential.</p>

<p>I believe Silverlight was the beginning of a bigger idea to bring richness to every device. I am looking to build a community around this idea. As a previous Silverlight evangelist, I figured you would see the value.  I would love any kind of support you can lend.
