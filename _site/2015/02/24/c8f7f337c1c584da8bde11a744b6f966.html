<p>Hi John,
I am getting ready to re-write our legacy Silverlight/Caliburn/Devforce B2B application using your HotTowel Angular/Bootstrap/Breeze starter.  But, I have some doubts regarding BreezeJs+BreezeWebApi+EF vs. Angular+WebApi2+RestfulServices+EF.  Can you spare 15 mins to have a chat on Skype with me to calm my nerves?  synovia.doug is my handle.
Thanks,
Doug
