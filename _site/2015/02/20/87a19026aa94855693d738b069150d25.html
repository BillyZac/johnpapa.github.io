<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I wasn’t sure what channel was the best one to reach you at so I am trying your blog.</p>

<p>We are a traditional MS shop and use VS for development. On our first Angular project we did use Webstorm. We did also use gulp. I am not seeing a great advantage yet in using Webstorm over VS2013 in our current situation. The one thing I like about Webstorm is that it is not aware of server side frameworks such as ASP.NET so we can write pure HTML, JS and CSS and not be tempted to include ASP.NET in cases we want to also eventually wrap this in something like the Ionic Framework.</p>

<p>I am debating not using gulp and going back to using MS Build because we are not yet ready for NPM and Nodejs on our build server.</p>

<p>In your experience would suggest continuing with Webstorm or VS2013+?</p>

<p>We are on the fence about moving to another IDE when we don’t see it as absolutely necessary but not sure if I have all the facts as we are new to angular and client development and would appreciate your insight. I am not yet sure we are ready to work with NPM and Node JS so we may not be able to use gulp, bower, npm etc and am thinking we may need to use nuget (and create nuget packages when they dont exist. Could also build a private nuget onsite for the few packages we need).</p>

<p>Thanks in advance. Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>

<p>Thanks,
Andrew
