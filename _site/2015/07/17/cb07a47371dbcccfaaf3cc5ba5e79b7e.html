<p>Dear Mr. John Papa.</p>

<p>I am a computer-sience and math student and I almost finished. (In germany)
The last 3 years I spend all my free time in coding and because I love it to offer all my functionalities that you know from the desktop, node.js and angular became my love.</p>

<p>Using Angular brought me to you. I am a big fan of your blog articles and your youtube videos!
I always learn something new, and respect and try to reach your level!
(which will take some decades :/ )</p>

<p>Your blogs posts, your github projects and your youtube videos realy pushed me and gave me a guide what I have to research and what I have to learn, so thank you very very much for that.</p>

<p>Now I am a very big fan of your angular styleguides and I wanted to know if you can define some great node.js styleguides.</p>

<p>At the moment I cant realy implement “structure by feature” in a node.js app, so my node applications are still type structured.
Maybe you need another structure type? I dont know, thats why I hope you can help me because I realy respect your opinion.</p>

<p>Now I split my app in many small applications.
Lets say you have a products management application, in that case you would have
- a prducts database app
- a users database app (who can add, remove and edit products. Here you will find the schema and the roles of the users)
- a JWT token manager app (checks token, sends token)</p>

<p>All that listed apps are in their different folders.
All that apps have their own port numbers
All that apps have to be started via npm
All that apps are able to talk to each other</p>

<p>Why? 
- modular apps are started as processes so my OS will use other CPUs if needed
  (better than threads because my OS can handel that better than I can)
- scalable, even for enterprice applications
- modular apps are easy to test and they have only one esponsibility, which devides comlexity as well</p>

<p>It would be nice to hear your opinion about that and to know if you plan or are interested to make a styleguide for node applications (node APIs)</p>

<p>Thanks again for your great content that you share!</p>

<p>I look forward to hearing from you soon :)
