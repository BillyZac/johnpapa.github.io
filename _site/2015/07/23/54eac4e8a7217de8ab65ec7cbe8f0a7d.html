<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I’ve been following your Angular sessions on Pluralsight. I’m developing a mobile hybrid “freemium” app of which authentication/security is of highest priority. I’m using angular and web api and sql server. Would your ng-demos-jwt project be considered “bank level” security? Would a facebook or a linkedin or a mint  implement a security similar to yours or are they doing other things?
