<p>Hello John,</p>

<p>Sorry to bother you,</p>

<p>I like a lot your tutorials and guides and especially those concerning AngularJS. Congratulations about that !</p>

<p>I develop since September a very large Angular App : http://www.soonmap.com</p>

<p>It will be a mobile app and later a web app (using Ionic) and will be release during this summer (it’s nearly finished)</p>

<p>I tried to organize all in “modules” which seems the best strategy for a so large app</p>

<p>But I got some questions about what are best practises on specific use cases (if you have some time).</p>

<p>1) Take advantage of modules :  I would like to easily  disable modules from the module config file. I want some modules to be totally independant.</p>

<p>But modules can be used in lot of parts of the app (links, etc, etc)</p>

<p>I don’t know if there is a way to easily making all the app dynamic.
Example : only show in the menu modules available (maybe using your Router Helper).</p>

<p>2) Best practises to reuse only a ‘controller part’ of a module 
Let’s imagine we want to use a function of a controller on different templates on an application 
Is it considered a bad practise to do something like that ? :</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Or maybe creating a directive without template is a better way to manage that?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<p>Clément
