<p>Hi!</p>

<p>My name is Andra Zaharia and I’m writing to propose a cyber security product I believe could be useful and relevant for your readers.</p>

<p>Briefly, Heimdal PRO is a cyber threat protection suite which protects users against attacks that antivirus can’t block.</p>

<p>The product is powered by 3 key engines:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The advanced malware engine - protects users against the newest and most sophisticated types of malware.</li>
  <li>The traffic scanning engine - protects users against Zero Hour exploits, dangerous web locations, malicious content from legitimate websites, cybercriminal attacks and data leakage.</li>
  <li>The patching engine, which automatically and silently installs updates for the critical software that the user has installed. Cyber criminals use vulnerabilities in software to launch 65% of their attacks, so this is a crucial feature for any Internet user.</li>
</ol>

<p>Would you be interested in evaluating Heimdal PRO and see if it would make an appropriate recommendation for your readers?</p>

<p>Looking forward to your feedback!</p>
