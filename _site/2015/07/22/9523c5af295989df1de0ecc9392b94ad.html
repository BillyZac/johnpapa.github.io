<p>Hello John,</p>

<p>I am taking one of your Pluralsight courses ‘JavaScript Build Automation with Gulp.js”. I am learning a lot from you about using Gulp. I am having a slight problem with the viewing the website when I ran the gulp server-dev. I have no problem with the code. Everything checks out, however I get the GULP splash screen and nothing else come up. I have checked the google dev tool and the console deplays errors that states that it is unable to find the angular js files. If you can assist me with this, it would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>Malik W. Dixon, MS
