<p>Do you have a sec for a question?  You’re the only guy who has put down in writing the weirdness that is Wordpress on Azure.  I tried your steps, but it got even weirder.  I have a “retired” free 20 meg SQL database that looks like it should be Cleardb, but they claim it’s not theirs.  Wordpress just went through a security update and I can’t log in to my admin panel until I upgrade the database, which hangs when I try to use the Wordpress one-click update.  How did you find your database on Azure for Wordpress?  I can only find reference to the SQL one, and my MYSQL connection string is completely different, but the server is “localhost”.  I find Azure a bit infuriating, but I am locked out of my website that was created under an Azure script:  I can’t even export it to host it somewhere less weird.</p>

<p>If you have a sec, any advice on how I can find my mysql database for my Wordpress instance so I can upgrade it?  If not that, any idea what configuration file I should hack so Wordpress doesn’t force me into upgrading before I can get to my admin panel?</p>

<p>Your stuff was/is cool, but Cleardb is not acknowledging me as a customer, so everything I have is weirder than yours.</p>
