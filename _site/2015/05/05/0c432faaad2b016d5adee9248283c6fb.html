<p>// summary: what is your ‘guidance’ on accomplishing Lazy loading in Angular</p>

<p>Hello John,</p>

<p>I am ramping up on Angular and one topic that I have not found a solid answer for is ‘lazy loading’ in Angular.  So far the Gods of internet are pointing to ‘Require.JS’ and I get the define() and require(); however, still not 100% convinced if I need it since Angular already has solid DI.</p>

<p>But I guess to do ‘lazy’ loading I would need library like ‘Require.JS’ and that’s where it falls apart for me.  I have seen articles like Dan Whalin (http://weblogs.asp.net/dwahlin/dynamically-loading-controllers-and-views-with-angularjs-and-requirejs) but it is limited to work with $routeProvider and the whole approach is a bit murkey.</p>

<p>Anyhow, just wondering how do you go about addressing such needs in your large projects.</p>

<p>Suggestion: possibly do an episode regarding such topic on the ‘Adventures in Angular’ podcast (I am regular listener and greatly appreciate all of your guys hard work in it)
