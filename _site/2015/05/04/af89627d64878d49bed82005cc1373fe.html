<p>I’ll keep this short because we are all busy.</p>

<p>I need to decide which to use. Less, Sass, or Scss.</p>

<p>To help you know where I’m coming from I’ve been a Microsoft programmer for 20 years.  I know that sometimes means I will lean toward one technology over another like TypeScript over CoffeeScript.</p>

<p>This is probably an “it depends” question.  On your next project which of these would you be using?  I won’t quote you on it.  I just need to know because there is so much to learn.  I can’t seem to find a good opinion on this.</p>

<p>Thanks a bunch,
Bob
