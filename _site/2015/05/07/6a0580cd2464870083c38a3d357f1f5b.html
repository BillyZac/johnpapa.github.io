<p>Hello John,</p>

<p>I had a couple of questions for you.  I realize you get a ton of email so I understand that it may take time to get a response.</p>

<p>I was wondering if you ever do outside consulting or training?  I work for a non-profit organization called New Tribes Mission – www.ntm.org.  We have a small group of developers taking on a large project and could benefit from someone like yourself who has extensive experience consulting with us to ensure we start out on the right foot.</p>

<p>Secondly, I was wondering what your thoughts were on angluarjs vs. emberjs?  Have you worked with Ember and are there situations where you would recommend one platform over the other?</p>

<p>Thanks so much for your time.
