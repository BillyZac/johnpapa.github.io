<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I was reading your post about VS Code IntelliSense (http://www.johnpapa.net/intellisense-witha-visual-studio-code/), and I’m currently using it a lot since it’s simply awesome.</p>

<p>But I noticed that, whenever I pack code inside “module.exports = function() {}” for Node.js, I do not get code hinting “inside” this module. I do get it before en after (i.e. outside) the module.exports function.</p>

<p>My usecase is that I have all my Gulp tasks inside seperate files, which get called from the main gulpfile.js.</p>

<p>I checked the repo of Boris Yankov on GitHub, but couldn’t find any issues related. So my question: Do you know how to solve this?</p>

<p>Thanks and kind regards,</p>

<p>Nicky
