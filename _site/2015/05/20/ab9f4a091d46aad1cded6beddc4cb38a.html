<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>First of all may I say how great your tutorials are so far on pluralsight, your play by play with Ken Cenerelli really helped me kick start into angular after looking at Scott Allens beginner course with older techniques.</p>

<p>I like to learn by doing, and in order for me to develop my angular I thought about making an angular app that searches your style guide and i’m curious what you think would be the best way for me to extract the data it all to make each ‘item’ an object of some sort to make them easily filterable and with possible detail views.</p>

<p>Or maybe you could suggest what course to look at next on pluralsight as there seems so many to choose from but I’m not sure what’s good for beginners but that’s also fairly up to date.</p>

<p>Kind Regards,
Edward
