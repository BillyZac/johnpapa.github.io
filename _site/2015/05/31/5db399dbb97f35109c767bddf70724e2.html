<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I’ve been following your blog for a while and had watched your Visual Studio Code presentation on //build. Just wanted to share https://github.com/wasker/0-to-code with you - this is a set of tools that will setup all people need to get VS Code up and running, assuming they’ve never done that before. Just a little something to help out newcomers into the world of modern web dev.</p>

<p>Thanks.
