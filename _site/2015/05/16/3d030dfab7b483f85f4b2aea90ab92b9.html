<p>Dear John,</p>

<p>Over the weekend I implemented a repository and unit of work pattern in an application I am building. This was heaviliy inspired by the Data Models, Entity Framework, and Data Patterns module of your Pluralsight course Single Page Apps with HTML5, Web API, Knockout and jQuery.</p>

<p>I added a notice saying the above and the license of CodeCamper to the project.</p>

<p>See https://github.com/erooijak/oogstplanner/commit/7834f7ed57eb711d22bda9880276ec0b0f85284d.</p>

<p>I hope that will do. :-)</p>

<p>Thanks for the course and the project.</p>

<p>All the best,
Erwin Rooijakkers
