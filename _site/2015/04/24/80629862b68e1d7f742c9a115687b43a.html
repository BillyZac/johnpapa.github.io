<p>Hey John,
   I have a quick question about running .cshtml files through a build step.  I would love to use useref to create production ready bundles in a .Net MVC project (not ideal, I know but it could really help my client).  Have you ever done this to .cshtml files before and altered the Razor View Engine to look for views in another folder in production?  Any thoughts?</p>

<p>PS. 
Love your pluralsight course on build automation with gulp!
