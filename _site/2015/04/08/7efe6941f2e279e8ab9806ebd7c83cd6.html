<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>Impresses with your gulp course and the sample code on github. Using it for one of my projects.</p>

<p>Testing framework I want to use is Jasmine instead of Mocha. I am in the middle of changing your source code to run jasmine tests using Karma.</p>

<p>Is it possible? Will it be same as “gulp serve-specs” and run all tests in the browser?</p>

<p>Thanks
Asad
