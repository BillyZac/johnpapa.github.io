<p>Hi John!
My name’s Anton and I’m currently a student on the Web Development Programme at Linneaus University in Sweden (https://lnu.se). Right now I’m doing my second year paper, which focuses on Angular 1.3, componentish directives and HTTP calls.</p>

<p>I’m using a qualitative method for retrieving data and opinions for my research. I would like to do a short interview with you as an Angular Expert, discussing best practices for HTTP requests in apps that implement directives as components. It can be either over e-mail (easy in terms of potential time difference) or over Skype.</p>

<p>Would you be interested in participating?</p>

<p>Thanks for your time,
Anton
