<p>John, I am following your course on pluralsite “Building apps with angular and breeze part 1”. I downloaded and installed the SideWaffle extension but the angular templates don’t resemble the ones used in the course. Is that because of a change in angular or breeze or just at SideWaffle. The new side waffle templates don’t have any of the comment text and don’t match the structure in the course.</p>

<p>Thanks
