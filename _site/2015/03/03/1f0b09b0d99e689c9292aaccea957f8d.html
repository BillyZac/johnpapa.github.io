<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>Im wondering if you are going to put out a course, or an updated version of hottowel angular that includes mvc5 identity?</p>

<p>As someone getting into programming and SPA’s, this seems to be a main ‘MISSING’ thing. Im not sure what kind of applications one is supposed to build that does not include the ability to authenticate, authorize, manage users and roles etc. It really leaves me dumbfounded that this is such a massively overlooked thing.</p>

<p>Love your work by the way. Great tuts on pluralsight.
