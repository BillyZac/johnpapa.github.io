<p>John,</p>

<p>I spoke to you after the first session Saturday. If you would like, I would be willing to videotape any local presentations that you might do so they could reach a larger audience.</p>

<p>Here is a link to some work I did at the International Economic Development Council Leadership Conference that seems applicable in terms of technique and provides an example of the Sony XDCAM I am using.</p>

<p>https://www.youtube.com/user/rethinkingED</p>

<p>If you are posting the slides, the main thing is audio capture and enough of the screen so people can move though the slides.</p>

<p>I did not check the sessions for Codecamp until last Friday or I would have contacted you about trying to record your presentations Saturday.</p>

<p>BTW, your presentation on Gulp was really great! I have been using Ionic so I have been using it, but I had no idea about the customization capability.</p>

<p>Thanks!
