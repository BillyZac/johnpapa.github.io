<p>Dear John,</p>

<p>I need to implement similar to the one hosted in the http://cc-ng-z.azurewebsites.net/</p>

<p>Could you tell me where I would get the code for the http://cc-ng-z.azurewebsites.net/ site.</p>

<p>I am specifically looking for speaker.html value passed to speakerdetail.html which will happen on-click of speaker profile picture.</p>

<p>Thanks,
Mauricio
