<p>Hello John,</p>

<p>I really like the HotTowel SPA template you created.  I am also looking at the AureliaJS framework and I was curious about how I could swap out DurandalJS in the HotTowel template to use Aurelia, so that I can do a side-by-side comparison using the rest of the template as a common framework?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Mike
