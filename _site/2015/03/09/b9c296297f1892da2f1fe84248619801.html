<p>Hey John,</p>

<p>I understand that you created toastr.js. Im working with a web designer who is looking to use toastr on his site. I was wondering if it is possible to have two toast banners on a site at once but in different positions? I have been trying everything but can’t seem to get it to work.</p>

<p>thanks,</p>
