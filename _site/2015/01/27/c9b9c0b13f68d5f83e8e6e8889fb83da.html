<p>HI John, I;m learning Knockout.js via Pluralsight and following along in your tutorial “Building HTML5 and Javascript Apps with MVVM and Knockout” but files are missing.  Where are the exercise files for 2-03-builtin-bindings tutorial module on Pluralsight.com? I’ve contacted customer service and they don’t have them.  Would you please post them?  That module would be extremely helpful to our HTML developers who are coding the UI of our apps.  Thanks!
