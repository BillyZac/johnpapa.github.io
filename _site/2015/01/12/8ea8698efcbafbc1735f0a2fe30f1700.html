<p>Hi John!
Hope you are having good time at Disney!
First of all I am really  sorry bothering you with this email. My name is Arjun Paudel and I am from Nepal. I was once a developer and also Microsoft MVP for 2 years. But since 2010 I joined a wrong job(!) as a support engineer(through Odesk) and I regret it now. 
Because of my financial condition, it will be difficult for me to lose a job but I have called it quit from this month. Now I want to get back to software development world again. But after so long, I am bit overwhelmed looking at the different technologies and confused too much.
After thinking a lot, I decided that I will follow your stack. When I watch your courses at plural-sight I feel like wow! You are a great teacher! But still I am missing something.I am not quite getting to speed and I feel like I am lacking what it takes to be a developer. 
I want to dedicate this year to learn programming only. I started my career with $30 a month and my last salary was $2300 a month but working on a closed ERP software as a support engineer which has no future, I feel like I am jeopardizing my career and will be at nowhere once this product comes to an end of life which is going to be real soon. And with that I am a virtual worker! 2300 is a lot of money for someone who is from Nepal where per capita GDP is $700! But as I said I am really feeling insecured and not enjoying the work too. I joined the job for money which was a bad decision of my life. So now I am ready to reboot and start from the beginning.</p>

<p>Could you please help me and give me some guidance? Like refer me good books to start with and a bit of career advice. Spending time on a individual is a waste of time for a professional like you who is doing so much for community. But I promise when I am ready to write some good code, I will help you by doing some of your time consuming work which are meant for community or even personal. Its not that I am not able to understand javascript/angualrJS/c# but I think I need to read more than that to be a proficient developer. And also confused about Node or WebAPI or WCF though it depends what you doing but what if I want to learn with no specific project, where to devote most of my time? I also feel my study is not well structured. I really want some homework kind of thing like what skills I need to master and distribute time for each in a year to be a developer like you :p</p>

<p>I know I am being stupid here but just writing you with the hope that a great teacher like you can have a better advice for people like me. Please do not laugh at me. Just ignore this stupid email if it makes no sense to you. Whatever you reply will remain with me and never publish/tweet anything anywhere which I promise.</p>

<p>I am sorry for my language skill too :(</p>

<p>Thanks
