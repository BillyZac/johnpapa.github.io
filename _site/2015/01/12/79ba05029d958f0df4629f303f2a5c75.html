<p>Hi John,
Hope you are doing great!! I’m huge fan of you of all the activities that you do in the technical area.</p>

<p>I’m using Glimpse MVC4 hugely.
Below is the one feature which im looking at to see the selected route as the first record in route tab</p>

<p>Since our application has hundreds of routes, it is really hard for us to scroll through the route tab for the selected route. Below is our UAT site for your reference</p>

<p>https://apps.joneslanglasalle.com/WAU/PS/canada-en-ca</p>

<p>It would be really great if you can help me achieve the above problem. I tried getting the source code from git and narrowed down to change the glimpse.js client javascript file. But not sure how to proceed further to use this javascript file in my application. Because Glimpse client side file is rendered as webresource.axd.</p>

<p>I also went through your article about your toastr glimpse plugin. So if you can guide me how to accomplish the above would be really really great.</p>

<p>Your help is highly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks,
Arun
