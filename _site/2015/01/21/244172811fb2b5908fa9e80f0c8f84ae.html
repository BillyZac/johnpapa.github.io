<p>Hey John,
hopefully you can help me :)</p>

<p>I tried to put you´r durandal breeze starter kit into phonegap….horribly failed doing that. Not sure why but somehow cordova does not seem to work with require.js or i don´t know how.</p>

<p>Is it possible to use durandal for cordova/phonegap?</p>

<p>Do you have any working example for set?</p>

<p>On the other hand..talking about an android/iphone html5 app….is durandal too much overhead? would angular perform better on mobile devices?</p>

<p>I´ve build a facebook app with durandal and tried to convert it into an android app…</p>

<p>regards,
Tim
