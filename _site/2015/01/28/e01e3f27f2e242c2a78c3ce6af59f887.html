<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I m a newbie in AngularJS and I found an excellent template from your site; Hot Towel Angular which is very useful. It helped me speed up my initial process of establishing a standard template.</p>

<p>Do you have anything similar that is based on angularjs 1.3?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>
