<p>PRIVATE MESSAGE</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I am hoping to make video tutorials about developing with Microsoft Access for Pluralsight.  I spoke with Nathan Granitz and he recommended I watch some of your video tutorials, which I have.  I can only hope to be as good as you someday!  Anyway, I am making my tryout video today and do not have the audition kit. I’ve written a script, an outline, and have everything setup to record with Camtasia.  Don’t want to lose my momentum.</p>

<p>I saw the PDF file that Nathan sent me had links and, unfortunately, did not attempt to download them sooner.  Today, I click on links and only see they point to files on MY drive that I do not have :(  Would it be possible for you to send me the audition kit?  Specifically, I need the fonts and the PowerPoint template.</p>

<p>I am doing my tryout video on a tool I built with Access to make caption files for videos (which Pluralsight does support – just not many authors do it since they don’t know that) … maybe Pluralsight will make this video available for other authors too :)</p>

<p>btw, I have been making videos for 5 years and have 2 YouTube channels:</p>

<p>www.YouTube.com/LearnAccessByCrystal (Access, Excel, Word, and PowerPoint videos)
www.YouTube.com/LearnByCrystal (Windows and Windows Phone development videos)</p>

<p>thank you, John</p>

<p>Warm Regards,
