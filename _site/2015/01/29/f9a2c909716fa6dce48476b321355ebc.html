<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>Tried a tweet but couldn’t fit it in one, so that’s why I send this by email.
In regards to AngularJS I’m curious where you stand on the subject of filters. Should we use them in our views (mixing things up, no MVC) or in the controller only making use of the $filter service (which also increases testabilit)y. I’m curious because I try to follow on your guidelines on Angular but are missing this subject and it’s something that been on my mind for a while now. The same goes for other logic in your view like setting variables and using them to enable/disable stuff. I like to think it’s a bad practice but like to here th experts opinion on this.</p>

<p>Hope you can give me your insight on this and maybe it’s something to add to the guidelines as wel..</p>

<p>With kind regards,
Bas Slagter
