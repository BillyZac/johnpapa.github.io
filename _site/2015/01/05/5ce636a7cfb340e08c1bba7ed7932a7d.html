<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>Your angular style guide is just amazing! I’ve read it twice, and now I’m refactoring my project with this style. Thanks for the amazing work.</p>

<p>I have a quick question: I created lots of javascript files, as well as many sub directories. Now I have a little problem with importing them into the index.html. Do I have to manually import all the files into index.html? Or is there any tool or style guide to resolve this problem more smartly?</p>

<p>I’m sorry if the question is too basic, I’m just a new angular developer.</p>

<p>I appreciate your help and am looking forward your reply :-)</p>

<p>Regards,
Dara Zheng
