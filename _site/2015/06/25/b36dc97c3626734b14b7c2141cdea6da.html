<p>Hi John. Its amazing your knowledge. Ive learned a lot at pluralsight, just by watching your classes.</p>

<p>And there is a question, maybe silly question, i’d like to do… How can you learn so many different technologies?</p>

<p>Is there a best practice that facilitates on learning new subjects? Like, never start a new course/research until finishes a previous one … Or something like that…</p>

<p>Cheers from Brazil and thank you very much!</p>

<p>Bruno Marcondes.
