<p>Hello John,</p>

<p>I’m Alden Daniels, an Austin-based software engineer. June 23rd, 2015, I’ll be launching a Kickstarter campaign for Codr - a collaborative text editor for code. I’d be honored if, before the campaign launch, you’d take a few minutes to try it out and let me know what you think.</p>

<p>As a web developer, I appreciate the energy that you invest in socializing insights and best practices with the developer community through your books, weblog, and speaking engagements. Suffice it to say that your feedback regarding Codr and Codr’s vision for connected development is deeply appreciated.</p>

<p>Codr enables software developers to code together in real-time from anywhere. It’s like a lightweight Google Docs for code. For web developers, Codr also doubles as a shared reactive work surface: every change is instantly visualized for all viewers via Codr’s integrated HTML preview pane. Alongside tools like GitHub and Slack, Codr makes the long-distance software team more effective.</p>

<p>Here’s a private login so you can try it out: http://johnpapa.preview.codr.io. Additionally here are (confidential) links to the:

Kickstarter Campaign Page (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1600972049/1542571912?token=aca7dadb).</p>

<p>I’d also be delighted to give you a personal demo.</p>

<p>Thanks for your time!</p>
