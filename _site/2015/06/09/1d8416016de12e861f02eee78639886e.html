<p>Hello John,</p>

<p>I already watched some of your presentations (Channel 9) on Visual Studio Code. I have 1 concrete question:</p>

<p>I would like using the “System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager” class or the “Microsoft.WindowsAzure.CloudConfigurationManager” class in an app. For the latter I added already “Microsoft.WindowsAzure.ConfigurationManager” by executing “dnu install Microsoft.WindowsAzure.ConfigurationManager”. But I can’t use neither of the 2 classes in my App? Any idea why? 
Thanks.
Guy
