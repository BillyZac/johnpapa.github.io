<p>Hey John,</p>

<p>I am building a test application with Angular. The goal is to test the feasibility of rebuilding an old, heavy PowerBuilder application as a web application.</p>

<p>I found your Angular JS Style Guide and loved it. Thanks for the great work!</p>

<p>At first, I started playing with Angular 1.3 – and then came 1.4 and now 2.0 with Web Components – which looks awesome, especially thinking about separation of concerns and making the application more loosely coupled. Then there is Aurelia, JSBlocks and what more popping up every night. I am left a bit puzzled as to the nature of today’s web development.</p>

<p>Is there no “Angular JS Component Framework” that lets me just focus on the business logic when developing web applications – or do I constantly have to care about the ever-changing world of web and constantly have to patchwork every new application with an endless stream of better-than-the-other components?</p>

<p>I thought I had found an answer in Telerik Kendo UI, but after having struggled with for a while, I finally abandonned it and started using the Angular UI components. What I’d like to see is a complete component set with everything I need to build applications - so that I can focus on the business logic and not hacking components.</p>

<p>I have great confidence in your opinion, and therefore I stand in awe if you would lend me a few minutes to tell me your opinion on this issue.﻿
