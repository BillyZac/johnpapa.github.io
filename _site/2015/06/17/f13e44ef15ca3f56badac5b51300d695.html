<p>Dear John,</p>

<p>I am a PluralSight subscriber and I am working on a reasonably complex Web Application project, where architecture and design to the Client Side code seems non-trivial. I would like to understand the cost that you would quote for your Personal Mentoring OR Architecture Services.</p>

<p>The Web Application project entails emulating an existing Desktop WPF Application. The Web Application would be very UI extensive and hence, the customer wants to use Kendo, JavaScript, CometD, HTML 5.</p>

<p>Please let me know your Per Hour charges. Look forward to your response. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Best Regards,
Nilesh Padbidri
