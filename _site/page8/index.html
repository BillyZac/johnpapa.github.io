  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p><img src="http://sidewaffle.com/img/logo.png" width="96" height="96" class="alignright" />Hungry for some file templates to get you started in the morning? Well now you can fill up on a set of web template packs for Visual Studio 2012 and 2013. <a href="http://www.sidewaffle.com" target="_blank">SideWaffle</a> is an open source project that creates a Visual Studio extension containing a set of file templates you can use for web projects.</p>

<p>SideWaffle currently has several templates including 10 I contributed for <a href="http://www.angularjs.org" target="_blank">Angular</a>, <a href="http://www.durandaljs.com" target="_blank">Durandal</a>, and creating a JavaScript IIFE. One of the best parts is that SideWaffle will be frequently updated with new and useful templates (they do check for high quality templates). I expect that in the near term we’ll see a lot of additions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Angular Controller (using Controller As syntax)</li>
<li>Angular Controller (using $scope)</li>
<li>Angular Directive (creates a skeleton for a directive)</li>
<li>Angular Factory (great for data, logging, and other services)</li>
<li>Angular Module (sets up a module)</li>
<li>Durandal ViewModel</li>
<li>Durandal Service</li>
<li>Durandal main.js (common creation syntax for kicking off Durandal)</li>
<li>JavaScript IIFE (Basic IIFE using vanilla.js)

I use the Angular templates in my upcoming course at <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com" target="_blank">Pluralsight</a> on using Angular and Breeze to build a powerful SPA.
<h2>What's in it for You?</h2>
Imagine you are in a web project writing Angular code. You want to create a new Angular controller. What do you do today? You might create a new JavaScript file and use a <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/angularjs-code-snippets-for-visual-studio/" target="_blank">code snippet like my <code>ngctrl</code> snippet</a>, or you could write it from scratch. But now with SideWaffle you can click <code>CTRL+SHIFT+A</code> to add a new file and choose the Angular Controller file template from SideWaffle. 
<img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SideWaffle-600x452.png" alt="SideWaffle" width="600" height="452" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-20321" />

So when you open the Add New Item dialog, choose the SideWaffle sub-folder (just to narrow the scope) and/or search for the template name in the search box. Then select the template and enter the name for the file. Some of the templates will use the file and/or project name where appropriate in generating the file. Below is an example of what the Angular Controller template generates when you name the file <code>sessions.js</code>. The whole idea is to get you started.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
(function () {
    'use strict';

    // Controller name is handy for logging
    var controllerId = 'sessions';

    // Define the controller on the module.
    // Inject the dependencies. 
    // Point to the controller definition function.
    angular.module('app').controller(controllerId,
        ['$scope', sessions]);

    function sessions($scope) {
        // Using 'Controller As' syntax, so we 
        // assign this to the vm variable (for viewmodel).
        var vm = this;

        // Bindable properties &amp; functions are placed on vm
        vm.activate = activate;
        vm.title = 'sessions';

        function activate() {
        }

        //#region Internal Methods        

        //#endregion
    }
})();
</pre> 

Or imagine you are creating a module for your Angular app and you forgot the exact syntax to use. You can use the Angular Module template from SideWaffle and name the file app.js and it would generate the following code.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
(function () {
    'use strict';

    // Module name is handy for logging
    var id = 'app';

    // Create the module and define its dependencies.
    var app = angular.module('app', [
        // Angular modules 
        'ngAnimate',        // animations
        'ngRoute'           // routing

        // Custom modules 

        // 3rd Party Modules
        
    ]);

    // Execute bootstrapping code and any dependencies.
    app.run(['$q', '$rootScope',
        function ($q, $rootScope) {

        }]);
})();
</pre>
Notice the template puts a few dependencies in for some common modules such as <code>ngRoute</code> and <code>ngAnimate</code>. it also reminds you to add any other custom or 3rd party modules in the dependency list. Then it creates the kickoff code in <code>app.run</code>, injecting <code>$q</code> and <code>$rootscope</code>, two common dependencies. As a template, you can then modify whatever you need, of course.

The Durandal and JavaScript IIFE templates work in a similar fashion. Grab the SideWaffle VSIX, install it and give it a shot!
<h2>Contribute</h2>
Because it is open source, you can fork the repository, add your own templates, and make a pull request. The repository is managed by <a href="https://twitter.com/mkristensen" target="_blank">Mads Kristensen</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/sayedihashimi" target="_blank">Sayed Hashimi</a>.

So if you are interested in creating a new template, dig in. Quoting Mads ...
<blockquote>We’ve made sure to modify the project’s build system, so it automatically creates the VSIX based on the items in the project. Writing item templates have never been this easy. See the video below, it explains everything. The project is a VSIX containing item templates for all kinds of web related scenarios. For instance robots.txt, requireJS scaffolds etc.
</blockquote>

Here is a quick video from Mads that tells you pretty much all you need to know on what they are and how to create one.

    <a href="/angular/durandal/jquery/knockout/requirejs/spa/uncategorized/2013/08/22/compare-durandal-to-angular-not-knockout-to-angular.html">Compare Durandal to Angular, Not Knockout to Angular</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Odds are you have been asked recently: “How does <a href="http://www.knockoutjs.com" target="_blank">KnockoutJS </a>compare to <a href="http://www.angularjs.org" target="_blank">AngularJS</a>?” There seems to be a lot of attempts to compare these two awesome libraries. We can certainly compare them, but will this really get you where you want to go?</p>

<p>If you hear this question, ask “why” the person is asking it. If s/he wants a JavaScript/HTML based presentation framework then suggest that you compare <a href="http://durandaljs.com/" target="_blank">Durandal</a> to Angular. Why? Because Knockout is at heart a data-binding library, while Angular and Durandal are presentation frameworks. This is a hugely important concept to grasp, so let’s break down what’s at the heart of these questions and how Knockout, Durandal and Angular approach them. But let’s be clear: <strong>Knockout rocks. Durandal rocks. Angular rocks.</strong></p>

<p>Below is a snapshot of the libraries that each uses.
<img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ng-d-600x280.png" alt="ng-d" width="600" height="280" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-20011" /></p>

<h2>Under the Covers</h2>
<p>Angular uses <a href="http://api.jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a> if present and falls back to its own <a href="http://docs.angularjs.org/api/angular.element" target="_blank">jqLite</a> otherwise. Durandal uses Knockout for data binding, RequireJS for dependency management, and jQuery (tho I can see this dwindling to a jqLite type presence in the future). They both uses promises too, which is a good thing!</p>
<blockquote>If you want to discuss and compare Angular and Durandal as SPA presentation frameworks, check out my upcoming <a href="https://www.anglebrackets.org/workshops.aspx" target="_blank">full day workshop and sessions at AngleBrackets and DevIntersections</a> October 27-30, 2013. <a href="https://www.anglebrackets.org/register.aspx" target="_blank">Register with code &lt;strongPAPA to get a $50 discount too!</a> Douglass Crockford, Scott Guthrie, Scott Hanselman and Dan Wahlin will all be there too.
</blockquote>

<h2>Data Binding</h2>
<p>Knockout does data binding very very well. Angular does data binding very well too, but it also does routing, animations, view orchestration, and more. Most people who dive into Knockout and Angular get this far and understand that. But the next step is understanding “why” Knockout doesn’t do more. This is because Knockout is a data binding library. It’s not a SPA framework.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://jpapa.me/spaps" target="_blank">Pluralsight course on building a SPA</a> uses Knockout extensively, but it also uses many other libraries to handle aspects that were essential to the app I built. I used Sammy for routing, RequireJS for dependency injection, jQuery for http calls, and so on. I used those libraries because they do their “thing” very well, just like Knockout does its “thing” very well. And they all work together very well. Durandal and Angular strive to do data binding + more (we’ll get to those soon).</p>

<p>With Knockout we can data bind like this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
// JavaScript
var vm = {
    firstName = ko.observable('John')
};
ko.applyBindings(vm);
</pre>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<!-- HTML -->
<input data-bind="value:firstName" />
</pre>
<p>With Angular we data-bind like this.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
// JavaScript
// Inside of a personController
this.firstName = 'John';
</pre>
<p>And the Angular HTML markup using the new “Controller As” syntax which I prefer over <code>$scope.firstName</code>.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
<!-- HTML -->
<div ng-controller="personController as vm">
    <input ng-model="vm.firstName" />
</div>
</pre>
<p>There are syntax differences, but data binding is quite simple either way.</p>

<h2>Those Darn Parenthesis!</h2>
<p>You can’t talk about Knockout and Angular without addressing the “parenthesis” issue. So let’s take a quick diversion here.</p>

<p>Angular handles data binding using a dirty checking strategy via watches and its digest cycle. What may mean more to you is that Angular allows you to bind to Plain Old JavaScript Objects (POJO) with two-way binding and changes will propagate to all binding instances of that property. If you want this with Knockout then you will be using ko.observable(), which uses the observer pattern to notify all bindings and sources when the properties change. The implementations are very different, but both are effective.</p>

<p>So why do you care? Because with Knockout that means you often have to use parenthesis to unwrap your observables to get to their values. Notice the HTML below and its parenthesis in the HTML.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
<input data-bind="value:customer().contactPerson().firstName" />
</pre>

<p>This can be a pain point and is one of the reasons folks lean to Angular. However, Knockout and Durandal 2.x have plug-ins/modules that will remove the parenthesis issue (for ES5 supported browsers). That is a topic for which I will blog about later, but for now <a href="http://durandaljs.com/documentation/Binding-Plain-Javascript-Objects/" target="_blank">read more here</a>. This will allow you to do this with Knockout/Durandal.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
<input data-bind="value:customer.contactPerson.firstName" />
</pre>
<p>Which is much more comparable to Angular.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
<input ng-model="customer.contactPerson.firstName" />
</pre>

<h2>Why Durandal and not Knockout?</h2>
<p>So let’s get back to the question of which one (of Knockout and Angular) to use for a SPA. Knockout is just data binding, so if you want more than that, you could just use Angular. Or, you could look at Durandal and Angular. Why Durandal? Because it is a presentation framework on the same level as Angular. They solve the same problems (in different ways of course). They both have routing, animations, view orchestration, dependency management, as well as data binding.</p>

<p>Durandal is a natural progression from Knockout because Durandal uses Knockout. In fact, Knockout is baked throughout Durandal. Durandal uses Knockout for data binding because its solid, very widespread, and reliable. Angular rolled their own data binding.</p>

<h2>What Have We Learned?</h2>
<p>The comparison of Knockout to Angular is apples to oranges. Well, maybe more like comparing the engine of a Ferrari to an entire Lamborghini. The both do data binding, but Angular strives to do more (presentation framework) while Knockout strives to do data binding only. There are offshoots of data binding features too. For example, Angular has directives (commonly for attributes and elements) and Knockout allows you create binding handlers (for inside the data-bind) or even binding providers (create your own attributes/elements).  My point here is that data binding is powerful and both of these fine gentlemen realize that and take advantage of it. However, Angular goes further. This is where Durandal steps in and builds on top of Knockout.</p>

<p>So the next time you are asked about Knockout or Angular for a presentation framework, redirect the question to Durandal and Angular.</p>

    <p>Controllers, services and directives are some of the core features in <a href="http://www.angularjs.org" target="_blank">AngularJS</a> where you’ll end up writing a lot of your code. So why not reduce the friction and keep them consistent?</p>

<p>There is a lot of value in using consistent patterns in code. When I find myself using one, I create snippets to help me stick with the pattern. When the pattern evolves, I change the snippets to evolve with them. Recently I found myself using a similar pattern for create Angular controllers, factories/services and directives. So it just made sense to create Visual Studio snippets for each of them and share them. I use these and many other patterns in my upcoming course at <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com" target="_blank">Pluralsight</a> on using Angular and Breeze to build a powerful SPA.</p>

<h2>AngularJS Snippets</h2>
<p>There’s a great set of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms165394.aspx" target="_blank">simple instructions on this MSDN post</a> for creating snippets. I recommend reading this through so you can create your own, or modify mine to suit your needs.</p>
<h2>Controllers</h2>
<p>I created <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/downloads/ng-snippets.zip" target="_blank">snippets for creating controllers, services via factories, and directives</a> using a pattern that’s emerged for me. You can <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/files/downloads/ng-snippets.zip" target="_blank">download them here</a>.</p>

<p>Once you grab these, go ahead and install them in Visual Studio. Type <code>CTRL K, CTRL B</code> to get to the Code Snippets Manager. Select JavaScript as the language, open My Code Snippets, then click the import button. Locate each snippet and import them.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
(function () {
    'use strict';
    var controllerId = 'customController';
    angular.module('app').controller(controllerId,
        ['$scope', customController]);
    function customController($scope) {
        var vm = this;
        vm.activate = activate;
        function activate() {
        }
        //#region Internal Methods        
        //#endregion
    }
})();
</pre>
<p>Once you have the snippets, simply type the shortcut for the snippet you want followed by the <code>TAB</code> key and the snippet will appear. For example, when you type <code>ngctrl</code> followed by <code>TAB</code> you will see the code shown above. I use this when I open a file and create a new controller from scratch. The snippets prompt me to fill in all of the customizable parts such as module name, controller name, and first of the dependencies.</p>
<h2>Diversion to Controller As</h2>
<p>It also lays out the structure for how I like my controllers to look. For example, I often use the <code>controller as</code> syntax (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTihyXaz4Bo" target="_blank">learn more here in John Lindquist’s video</a>) which melds nicely with writing the properties that I want to bind inside my View using the <code>this</code> syntax. Say what? OK, so basically I create a viewmodel variable called <code>vm</code> and I set all of my bindable members on it. Then that becomes the part that gets bound to the View when using the <code>controller as</code> syntax. So I create <code>vm</code> and set it to <code>this</code>. Then all of the properties on that object become bindable.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
function sessions(config) {
    var vm = this;
    var keyCodes = config.keyCodes;
    var applyFilter = function (){};
    vm.refresh = refresh;
    vm.search = search;
    vm.sessions = [];
    vm.title = 'Sessions';
</pre>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The <code>ngservice</code> snippet will create the code for a service factory. Again, the snippet will prompt you to fill in the customizable aspects. Then you can fill in the accessible members of the service by setting them on the <code>service</code> object. Here I start with one called getData as a starting place. This is akin to the Revealing Module Pattern which helps expose the members we want to be accessible, yet keep other internal. This is ideal for any service that may get/save data, log, store to local storage, or perform any custom service you need.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
(function () {
    'use strict';
    var serviceId = 'customService';
    angular.module('app').factory(serviceId, 
        ['config', customService]);
    function customService(config) {
        var service = {
            getData: getData
        };
        return service;
        function getData() {
        }
        //#region Internal Methods        
        //#endregion
    }
})();
</pre>
<h2>Directives</h2>
<p>The <code>ngdir</code> snippet creates the beginnings of a directive. The snippet let you fill in the module name, directive name, first of the dependencies, and provides a structure for setting the aspects of a directive (such as the <code>link</code> function). It also provide the comments I often use with a directive to help me recall how to call the directive, and what the directive creates (if it has a template). Again, this is a starting point for a directive, and quite often I will add more to it (ex: scope, template, compile). But this is a nice common place to get it all started.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
app.directive('customDirective', 
        ['$window', function ($window) {
    // Usage:
    // 
    // Creates:
    // 
    var directive = {
        link: link,
        restrict: 'A'
    };
    return directive;
    function link(scope, element, attrs) {
    }
}]);
</pre>
<h2>Consistency</h2>
<p>It is not important to use the patterns that I use. What is important is for you to use a pattern and be consistent within your own app. The patterns are helpful but another thing these snippets help with is minification protection for the injected dependencies. This can sometimes be forgotten when coding fast, so these snippets help me set that in place without having to think about it (or before I forget about it).</p>

<p>I’ll continue to evolve these over time and certainly I hope these are as useful to you as they are to me!</p>

    <a href="/angular/animation/javascript/spa/uncategorized/2013/08/15/preparing-for-animations-in-angular-1-2-0.html">Preparing for Animations in Angular 1.2.0</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>This week <a href="http://blog.angularjs.org/" target="_blank">Angular 1.2.0 rc1 was released</a> and its jam-packed with goodness. You can check out the <a href="http://code.angularjs.org/1.2.0rc1/docs/api" target="_blank">release notes</a> and <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md" target="_blank">change log here</a>. There are a lot of improvements over the previous stable release. If you have been using the “unstable” branches such as 1.1.5, be aware that there are a few breaking changes. One of those is in the use of the new animations feature, which I’ll discuss here.</p>

<p>If you want to <a href="http://plnkr.co/edit/b1hoRXBreMMi6zIuQXr2" target="_blank">jump right to an example, click on this plunker</a>, then come back for the explanation. I’ll have more animation examples in my upcoming course at <a href="http://ww.pluralsight.com" target="_blank">Pluralsight</a> on using Angular and Breeze to build a powerful SPA.</p>

<blockquote>Special thanks to Matias Niemelā of the Angular team for helping me test the features. And more importantly, for his great animations work on the <a href="http://www.yearofmoo.com" target="_blank">yearofmoo</a>.</blockquote>

<h2>Cheat Sheet</h2>
<p>Here are the directives that support animations <a href="http://ci.angularjs.org/job/angular.js-angular-master/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build/docs/api/ngAnimate" target="_blank">(see the docs for more details)</a>.</p>
<ul><li><code>ngRepeat</code> enter, leave and move</li>
<li><code>ngView</code> enter and leave</li>
<li><code>ngInclude</code> enter and leave</li>
<li><code>ngSwitch</code> enter and leave</li>
<li><code>ngIf</code> enter and leave</li>
<li><code>ngClass</code> add and remove</li>
<li><code>ngShow</code> &amp; <code>ngHide</code> add and remove (the ng-hide class value)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conventions</h2>
<p>The convention for using the animations is to define the starting and termination animations using a naming convention. For example, let’s create an animation that fades in and fades out for <code>ng-include</code> with an animation called <code>fader-animation</code>. Then we’ll add its starting and terminating states.</p>

<p>Here is how we will apply the animation once we write it.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
    <div ng-include="'/app/views/myview.html'" ng-class="fader-animation"></div>
</pre>

<p>And now we create the CSS for the fader-animation.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
// Starting animation for enter
.fader-animation.ng-enter
// Terminating animation for enter
.fader-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active
// Starting animation for leave
.fader-animation.ng-leave
// Terminating animation for leave
.fader-animation.ng-leave.ng-leave-active
</pre>
<p>When Angular sees a class defined along with one of the supported directives from the above cheat sheet, it will add the styles for them. In the case of <code>ng-include</code>, it will add <code>ng-enter</code>, <code>ng-enter-active</code>, <code>ng-leave</code>, and <code>ng-leave-active</code> at the appropriate times.</p>

<p>Once we define these we can mix them up to create a simple fader animation. First, define the transitions for the animations. This says we want to transition for all supported CSS properties using a cubic-bezier easing for a duration of half a second.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
.fader-animation.ng-enter,
.fader-animation.ng-leave {
    -webkit-transition: all cubic-bezier(0.250, 0.460, 0.450, 0.940) 0.5s;
    -moz-transition: all cubic-bezier(0.250, 0.460, 0.450, 0.940) 0.5s;
    -o-transition: all cubic-bezier(0.250, 0.460, 0.450, 0.940) 0.5s;
    transition: all cubic-bezier(0.250, 0.460, 0.450, 0.940) 0.5s;
}
</pre>
<p>Next we set the starting and terminating states of the animations. When the template enters we want it to have an opacity of 0. When it has finished entering, its opacity should be 1.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
.fader-animation.ng-enter {
    -ms-opacity: 0;
    opacity: 0;
}
.fader-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
    -ms-opacity: 1;
    opacity: 1;
}
</pre>
<p>When the template starts to leave we want it to have an opacity of 1. When it has finished leaving, its opacity should be 0.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
.fader-animation.ng-leave {
    -ms-opacity: 1;
    opacity: 1;
}
.fader-animation.ng-leave.ng-leave-active {
    -ms-opacity: 0;
    opacity: 0;
}
</pre>
<h2>Converting from the ngAnimate Directive</h2>
<p>If you have used the <code>ngAnimate</code> directive in Angular 1.1.5, then you’ll want to make sure you read this section and the docs on what has changed with them.</p>
<ul>
	<li>ngAnimate directive</li>
	<li>ngAnimate module</li>
	<li>Conventions</li>
</ul>
<p>Angular, like some other libraries, is moving towards a modular structure. This is emerging more in 1.2.0 with several modules being broken out, including <code>ngSanitize</code>, <code>ngRoute</code>, and <code>ngAnimate</code>. That’s right, <code>ngAnimate</code> is now a module in a separate file that you can include or exclude.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
// create the app module, and declare
// that it depends on the ngAnmiate module
angular.module('app', ['ngAnimate']);
</pre>
<p>You’ll want to go grab the file from the Angular site. Just click the Download button, then Unstable (for v1.2.0), and the Extras link to see the available modules.</p>

<p>You may also notice that the <code>ng-animate</code> directive is no longer used. It was in the unstable branch, so you’d only have hit this if you were using it like I was. So what happened? You can now put the CSS class right in a <code>class</code> attribute or the <code>ng-class</code> directive.</p>

<p>Finally, the naming conventions have changed. I won’t go into what they were, since it was in the unstable branch. But if you already have animations, you will want to use the conventions I show at the beginning of this post.</p>

<h2>Upgrade Tips</h2>
<p>It did not take me long to upgrade my code from 1.1.5 to 1.2.0 rc1, however I did hit some problems with the animations. First, the enter transitions were not working for me in all cases with <code>ng-include</code> and <code>ng-view</code>. Long story short, the Angular team is aware of this and a fix is already planned for 1.2.0 rc2. No errors occurred,the enter transitions simply were not firing due to how the DOM was being changed.</p>

<p>Another issue I ran into was with the <code>ui-view</code> directive from <a href="https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router" target="_blank">the ui-router project</a>. UI-Router is an alternative router you can use with Angular that also supports state. It does not yet support the new animations in 1.2.0, though I expect it will in the near future. I reiterate this only affects UI-Router. The Angular router and <code>ng-view</code> do work with the animations as shown in the 1.2.0 docs.</p>

<p>If you are using the show and hide animations then you’ll want to pay attention to the tips on the Angular site about creating a CSS class for <code>ng-hide</code> yourself that sets <code>display:none</code>. They recommend creating it very early in your page for your entire SPA so that it is ready right away. This is important because you may have animations running right after startup in a race with Angular starting up. For more details, i recommend checking out the docs on this. Without it, my hide and show animations were showing then removing themselves at startup. With it, they started invisible, which is what I wanted.</p>

<h2>More Angular and SPA</h2>
<p>If you love SPA you should definitely check out the upcoming AngleBrackets conference in Las Vegas Oct 26-30. I’ll be hosting a full day workshop on SPA and presenting there on 2 great SPA frameworks: Angular and Durandal. My good friend Dan Wahlin is also presenting a few Angular sessions as well. Scott Hanselman, Douglass Crockford, Scott Guthrie, and many more will be there too! The event is co-located with DevIntersection, and one ticket gets you into both events. Better yet, you can <a href="https://www.anglebrackets.org/register.aspx" target="_blank"><strong>register now with the code <code>PAPA</code> and get a $50 discount</strong></a>! I hope to see you there!</p>

And while I love <em>my personal favorites Angular and Durandal</em>, it's not all magic. There is a learning curve and some things are helpful to decide up front. Once you choose your presentation framework, you should decide how you will organize the structure of your project.</p>

<blockquote><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Learn how you can <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/angular-growth-structure/" target="_blank">refactor your Angular structure for growth in my "sequel" post.</a>
</blockquote>

<p>In this post I'll show one way how I organize my Angular based projects and discuss why I like it.</p>

<p>Before you ask "Why didn't he mention <a href="http://www.knockoutjs.com" target="_blank">Knockout.js</a>? Doesn't he love it anymore?", let me answer that up front. Knockout.js is awesome. I love it. I use it. In fact, it is an integral piece of Durandal such that I often refer to Durandal as Durandal/Knockout. But that is the point: Durandal and Angular are frameworks. Frameworks handle a lot of things for you that cover most of the plumbing you need in a SPA. Knockout handles 1 thing: data binding. Now, it handles it very well and has some awesome features that crop out of it, like custom binding handlers and extensions. But I do not consider Knockout a complete framework, nor do I believe it is intended to be one. So you'll often hear me talk about Durandal and Knockout together as a framework choice.</p>

</blockquote>

<h2>Sorting Boxes</h2>

<p>Most of my client code ends up in one of these 4 folders. I like to keep code I wrote separate from code someone else wrote. Sounds pretty simple when you say that but I see a lot of projects where everything gets tossed in the same folder and it makes a mess to find what you need or run code analysis against just your code. (Who wants want to run static code analysis against angular or knockout?) I also want my tests separated from my app and all of my assets (images, fonts, css) in yet another folder.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">/app
/content
/scripts
/test
</pre>

<p>So for me, all of my code goes in the <code>app</code> folder, 3rd party or vendor scripts go in the <code>scripts</code> folder, assets in the <code>content</code> folder, and tests in the <code>test</code> folder.</p>

<h2>App Code</h2>

<p>My <code>app</code> folder is where all of my files I wrote for my app reside. This includes JavaScript and HTML files. The root of the folder is where I put my app.js which is my boot file. This is where all the magic starts and the application gets kicked off. For angular this means the modules get loaded and run. I generally name my root module <code>app</code>. I also usually create a config.js here to store all of my commonly used variables across the app. For angular I store these in <code>app.value</code> or <code>app.constant</code>.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">/app
    /controllers/
    /services/
    /views/
    /app.js
    /config.js
/content
/scripts
/test
</pre>

<h2>Controllers</h2>

<p>The <code>controllers</code> folder is where all of my controllers live. Makes sense, an app usually has several of them so why not put them all in one place. Notice what is not there though? The word "controller" in the name of the files. I'm not a fan of naming just for the sake of it. By putting all of my controllers in a <code>controllers</code> folder, guess what, I know they are controllers. I do not find an advantage in naming them "controller.session.js" or "sessionController.js". If you are wondering about the casing, I use camelCase because I it feels right :). That's just how I roll. When I use a controller, Angular creates a new one for each view instance. Should it be PascalCase ... that's your choice. It's more important to be consistent and understand that controllers come and go, and you can test this by tapping into the <code>$destroy</code> event.</p>

<h2>Services</h2>

<p>The <code>services</code> folder contains all of my services for the SPA. When I say services here I mean a unit of code that provides a discrete service to the rest of the app. I am not specifically talking about the Angular provider, service or factory, though these services may be constructed from those Angular features. I will generally have services for typical uses such as a logger, datacontext, routing, or storage. Sometimes I will add more specialized services here too such as work in progress or client side repositories. My services follow these 3 criteria: any set of code that can be ...</p>

<ul>
<li>reused</li>
<li>tested on its own</li>
<li>encapsulated </li>
</ul>

<p>I also put all of my directives in the <code>services</code> folder.</p>

<h4>Directives</h4>

<p>Generally I put them in a single file named <code>directives.js</code>. Some folks like to separate their directives, and I get it ... I just don't agree. I will often have several of these, but they are all small and often I want to look at other directives when I am developing new ones (for ideas). Now, I will create multiple files for directives if there is an obvious logical separation. For example, if I create a bunch of directives that apply just to using <a href="http://www.breezejs.com" target="_blank">BreezeJS</a> functionality, then sure, I'll make a file just for those. And what goes in a directive for me? Ideal candidates are any DOM interaction or events that are not covered by out of the box Angular directives. I also use this to wrap 3rd party widgets that I like. If I had a ton of directives and several files, then I would consider a new folder for them too. When I use filters, I also create a filters file in this folder. Some projects I don't use filters. Why? Well, that's a topic for another post.</p>

<h2>Views</h2>

<p>The final core folder is <code>views</code>, which is where my HTML resides. This includes inclusive views such as sessions.html. But it also includes partial views that may be inclusive or only intended to be used in another view. For example, some partial views have their own Angular controllers. These views can be placed in other views, and the controller comes with them. So they work anywhere. Then there are partial views that rely on some parent view. I tend to try to stick with the latter (views that have their own controller) ... that's just my preference. But I don't go nuts either way.</p>

<h2>Your Choice</h2>

<p>Ultimately how you organize your code is entirely up to you (and your team). I find it is immensely valuable to think it through before I start working with a team and tossing files all over the place. Having logical sorting boxes for all of your code just makes life easier. There are many ways to skin this cat so don't fret if you don't follow this exact pattern. That's what it is: a pattern. Not gospel.</p>

<h2>Next</h2>

<p>For smaller apps I find this structure quite simple, organizing by types. Once the app grows and starts expanding into multiple features and especially modules, I like to change the structure to group by feature. I'll explore this side by side a bit more in a future post. Both structures have value and really depend on how easy it is to find what you are looking for.</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>In the comments Joel mentions a <a href="http://cliffmeyers.com/blog/2013/4/21/code-organization-angularjs-javascript" target="_blank">great post by Cliff Meyers</a> that discusses another approach to organizing an Angular app. Cliff's approach is to organize by functional area. There is much wisdom in this choice too. Where I differ personally is if the app is in a single module I consider the module the functional area. Then once within that area, I choose to separate by type as discussed above. For me, once I see a different functional features, I consider making a new Angular module and separating from there. But again, these depend on your comfort. Happy coding!</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/haswell/intel/review/ultrabook/uncategorized/windows%208/2013/08/04/intel-haswell-first-look.html">Intel Haswell First Look</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I’m excited that I just received an Intel Haswell Ultrabook to review! Last year <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/win8sensors/" target="_blank">I reviewed an Intel Ivy Bridge Ultrabook with Windows 8 and touch screen</a>. Overall I was happy with the device, the hardware, and sensors. Battery life was so-so, but then again, it was about the same as most other machines so no big expectations there anyway. But this is a new year and the Intel Haswell chip has set some pretty big expectations. 
<img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/WP_20130804_010.jpg" alt="Intel Haswell Profile" width="554" height="337" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19311" />
The folks at Intel recently sent me a Haswell based Ultrabook to examine and provide feedback. They made it clear, in about every way imaginable other than a personal visit, that this is a model that will never be a production laptop “as-is”. It is branded as Intel for the purpose of reviewing and testing. Yet the parts are true Intel parts and these are what we’ll see in models very soon.</p>

<p>In this post I’ll be giving my impressions of the unboxing experience. I’ll follow up with a few more posts on how it performs after I have more time to put it through some real power use for extended periods.</p>

<h3>What I Like</h3>
<p>I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: I love lightweight, powerful, and fast computers. Lately we haven’t had to make as many sacrifices to get these types of laptops. In the past this meant giving up battery life, screen resolution, dongle craziness, noise reduction, speed, or other features. In my early usage, this Intel Haswell Ultrabook I received gives up very little and gives back so much.</p>

<p>The Ultrabook came with the a power block and cord, a 16GB USB stick loaded with drivers, 3 dongles (HDMI, VGA, Ethernet), and of course the Ultrabook itself. The packaging was neat … my kids loved it … when they opened the box with me it played the Intel jingle. So of course it took me about 10 minutes to actually unbox it because they kept opening and closing the box to hear the jingle.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/0VIITf_iLoE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<h2>Thin and Loaded</h2>
<p>When I sat down to write the specs for this Ultrabook I had to go look. That is significant because the Ultrabook performs very well and I would have guessed i7 with 8gb RAM and SSD. I was wrong. The Ultrabook is sleek and thin combined with an i5 1.40Ghz processor, 4GB RAM, and a 180GB SSD drive. I was concerned about speed since I normally prefer 8gb RAM and an i7, but so far this Ultrabook has not disappointed me at all in my early tests. Of course it has all the standard ports and then some (USB 3, Bluetooth, WiFi, SD card slot, and more) and it has 3 dongles for other adapters as I previously mentioned. I’m not a fan of dongles as I usually lose them, but its a minor nit.</p>

<h2>Keyboard and Touchpad</h2>
<p>The keyboard is very good, which surprised me since this is not an Intel thing. Remember that this Ultrabook is a reviewer model and pretty much everything is their brand for things they make (GPU, CPU, sensors, etc). Intel doesn’t make keyboards or cases, so I was surprised at how much I liked the keyboard. The touchpad is average … most of the time I use a mouse if possible, I’ve never used a great touchpad though.</p>

<h2>Touch Screen</h2>
<p>The screen looks really sharp and the colors are excellent. On par with my Surface pro! Of course this is a touch screen which is critical for a Windows 8 computer. The touch points performed very well, with no issues.</p>

<h2>Windows 8 Apps</h2>
<p>I tried out several Windows 8 store apps including some games like Toy Story Smash It, Royal Revolt, and Temple Run Brave. These looked and performed great especially with the touch, accelerometer, and gestures! In fact, my kids didn’t want to give the Ultrabook back to me after I let them try it. I also tried out several apps that used touch, location, and other sensors. Everything worked very well, which was as you would expect. (<a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/ultrabook-and-tablet-windows-8-sensors-development-guide/">You can learn more about these available sensors here</a>).

<h2>Writing Code and Battery Life</h2>
<p>In my early tests, from a powered off state I managed to boot and get to the login screen in just a few seconds. I loaded Visual Studio 2013 Preview and I worked on my next Angular and Breeze Single Page Apps project on this Intel Haswell Ultrabook for 5.5 hours straight on battery. When I stopped, the battery indicator said I had about 1.5 hours remaining. I was very impressed as I was using it heavily for the entire 5.5 hours. I’ve never had a Ultrabook that was a comfortable enough size, good screen, fast enough, and long enough battery life to sit nowhere near a plug. Usually I can get all of that but I need to stay plugged in.</p>

<p>I’ve now worked 2 days on this Intel Haswell Ultrabook and both days I have had similar experiences of about 6.5 to 7 hours of battery life before I had to plug in. While it is not the 12 hours that we hear sometimes, I never really believed that anyway since I hammer on the laptop non stop when I use it. 6.5 to 7 hours is double what I had before, so I’m looking forward to this!</p>

<h2>More to Come</h2>
<p>It’s only been 2 days but I’ll be trying this is my regular laptop over the next few weeks so I’ll report back on how it all goes.</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/css/fontawesome/javascript/toastr/uncategorized/2013/07/28/fontawesome-icons-with-toastr.html">FontAwesome Icons with Toastr</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>What do you get when you combine <a href="http://fontawesome.io/" target="_blank">FontAwesome</a> icons with <a href="http://toastrjs.com" target="_blank">Toastr</a>? Maybe ToastrAwesome or ToastAwesomer. If you have used Toastr then you know you can use your own CSS styling and make the toast look however you desire. Toastr comes with 4 basic icons as background images, but what FontAwesome allows you to do is use its icons instead of a background image. This post will show you how to do that so you can use any of the FontAwesome icons with Toastr, using only CSS.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/toast.png" alt="toast" width="395" height="79" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19201" /></p>

<p>This technique uses the CSS psuedo-selectors and works in IE8+, FireFox 21+, Chrome 26+, Safari 5.1+, most mobile browsers, according to <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=%3Abefore" target="_blank">CanIUse.com</a>. First, we need to remove the background-image and then we can set up our positioning for all toast content. You can tinker with the styles in the <code>.toastr:before</code> selector if you need something slightly different.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
#toast-container &gt; .toast {
    background-image: none !important;
}

#toast-container &gt; .toast:before {
    position: relative;
    font-family: FontAwesome;
    font-size: 24px;
    line-height: 18px;
    float: left;
    margin-left: -1em;
    color: #FFF;
    padding-right: 0.5em;
    margin-right: 0.5em;
}        
</pre>

<p>Next we can tell toastr which icon to use for each of the 4 toast types. We set this through the CSS content and set it to the icon that you desire. Here is a <a href="http://fontawesome.io/cheatsheet/" target="_blank">cheatsheet from FontAwesome</a> that can help you pick the right one for you.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
#toast-container &gt; .toast-warning:before {
    content: "\f003";
}
#toast-container &gt; .toast-error:before {
    content: "\f001";
}
#toast-container &gt; .toast-info:before {
    content: "\f005";
}
#toast-container &gt; .toast-success:before {
    content: "\f002";
}
</pre>

<p>And that’s it! If you want to see a <a href="http://plnkr.co/edit/6W9URNyyp2ItO4aUWzBB?p=preview" target="_blank">full demo, check out this plunker I whipped up</a>.</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/glimpse/toastr/uncategorized/2013/07/01/glimpse-for-toastr.html">Glimpse Extension for Toastr</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Glimpse.Toastr, a plugin for integrating toastr diagnostics into Glimpse, is now available on <a href="https://nuget.org/packages/glimpse.toastr" target="_blank">NuGet</a> and <a href="https://github.com/johnpapa/glimpse.toastr" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>If you haven’t checked out <a href="http://getglimpse.com/" target="_blank">Glimpse</a> yet, you are missing out. And if you haven’t checked it out recently, then definitely go grab the latest as its new Heads Up Display (HUD) is nothing but awesome-sauce! At a glance it gives you a ton of information to help debug your app. What makes Glimpse stand out is that it works in any browser (it’s not a browser plug-in), shows server or client information, and is constantly being improved.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/glimpse1-600x185.png" alt="Glimpse HUD" width="600" height="185" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-19001" /></p>

<h3>Glimpse Heads Up Display</h3>
<p>In its passive state, Glimpse’s HUD is a toolbar at the bottom of the page that updates dynamically as you interact with your app. It shows you some interesting stats based on the extensions that you enabled. The image above shows the request times for the page to load over HTTP, Ajax calls, and the controllers that fired. It’s active state is enabled when you roll over a specific area. This causes a panel to appear with even more detailed information.</p>

<p>Glimpse is billed as “the server information you need, where you want it”. It is a fantastic tool that provides quick insight into what is going on in your application from the browser. Glimpse has a core library and from there you can add <a href="http://getglimpse.com/Packages" target="_blank">different extensions</a> to help shed light on server features such as Entity Framework, Ninject, ASP.NET MVC, Newtonsoft Json and more. However, Glimpse can do more than just show you server information in the browser.</p>

<h3>Glimpse.Toastr</h3>
<p>Glimpse extensions rely on a core library that uses a glimpse.axd file in your web app. This is what helps drive the core server side functionality from the server. Then on the client there is a glimpse.js file that helps render the HUD in the browser. I wanted to disconnect the server and try to just use the client piece, so I could use Glimpse on any server to help shed light on client side code. Basically, skip the glimpse.axd on the server and just use glimpse.js with an extension.</p>

<p><img src="https://a248.e.akamai.net/camo.github.com/77b541f588180768927d92ac8e6c2a1870edb895/687474703a2f2f6a6f686e706170612e6e65742f77702d636f6e74656e742f696d616765732f676c696d7073652e746f617374722e706e67" width="1289" height="331" class="aligncenter" /></p>

<p>I contacted the creators of Glimpse, <a href="https://twitter.com/nikmd23" target="_blank">Nik Molnar</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/anthony_vdh" target="_blank">Anthony Vander hoorn</a>, and asked them for some help in getting jump-started with this. Luckily they had already begun thinking about this and it was relatively simple to get going. This is how I started writing the Glimpse extension for <a href="https://github.com/CodeSeven/toastr" target="_blank">Toastr</a>. In a future post I’ll dive more into how I created this extension so you can see how you can create your own extensions.</p>

<p>Glimpse.Toastr shows you information about the life-cycle of each toast. When it was shown/hidden, the type of toast, each toast’s configured options, toastr-wide options, and how long each toast lasted (see image above).</p>

<h3>Installing via NuGet</h3>
<p>You can install glimpse.toastr using NuGet by using the command <code>install-package glimpse.toastr -pre</code>. It is currently in pre-release as I am hoping to gather some feedback and work out any kinks.</p>

<h3>What's Next?</h3>
<p>Glimpse.Toastr is not currently in the HUD, but I am exploring how to add a small panel in the HUD for it. I’d also like to see the Glimpse team make the glimpse.js file be part of its own NuGet package so I can just pull in that one file. Currently there is a Glimpse core package that has the glimpse.js and the server components such as glimpse.axd. I can;t use that since it would put code on the server, which glimpse.toastr does not need. So for now I embedded the glimpse.js file directly into glimpse.toastr. But the right way to do this is to have it rely on a glimpse client core package.</p>
