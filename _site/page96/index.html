    <p>Its been about a month since my book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596523092/johnpanet-20">Data Driven Services with Silverlight 2</a> hit the stores just around Christmas. That last week of December I imagine people wanted to do other things like spend time with their families :), I know I did. But now that its had some time to permeate the market, the early reviews are starting to come in. So far its looking good … there are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/product/0596523092/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?_encoding=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1">six 4 or 5 star reviews on Amazon</a> (including one by <a href="http://www.timheuer.com">Tim Heuer</a>) and some early blog reviews, such as <a href="http://www.nxtgenug.net/Article.aspx?ArticleID=319">this detailed review</a> from <a href="http://www.nxtgenug.net/Article.aspx?ArticleID=319">Richard Costall of NxtGenUG</a>. (Thanks to everyone who wrote the reviews!)</p>
<p>Some people have asked what’s next for Silverlight 3 … and frankly I’d love to follow this up with an updated version for v3. It’s all about interest. So if you like the book, let my publisher O’Reilly Media know :-)</p>
<p>It’s always nerve racking reading other people’s opinions of your work, especially when that work took so&#160; much time and effort and is now in front of anyone who wants to look at it. There were times I rewrote entire sections of the book just to get the flow working better. Eventually, you just have to let it go and see if it flies or not.</p>
<p>While I am sure my book won’t please everyone out there, I am pleased with the early indications. So far so good.</p>

    <a href="/silverlight/2009/01/13/manipulating-service-references-in-silverlight-2.html">Manipulating Service References in Silverlight 2</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>When developing a Silverlight 2 project that uses WCF service references or <strike>ADO.NET Data Services</strike> Astoria references, and you want to push the builds to a test server, there are a few changes that need to be made so the references point to the test server and not the dev box. </p>
<p><a href="http://wildermuth.com/2008/11/08/Controlling_Service_References_in_Silverlight_2">Shawn Wildermuth has a great post</a> on this topic that explains the problem and also explains that when dealing with WCF service references, the ServiceReference.ClientConfig file can either be simply edited or a better option is to use compilation symbols to make the changes at compile time. For example, Shawn points out that you can create 2 endpoints in code in the ServiceReference.ClientConfig file in the Silverlight project: 1 for dev box and 1 for the test server. Then, in code the service can be instantiated using the following code (from Shawn’s post):</p>
<pre class="csharpcode"><span class="preproc">#if</span> DEBUG
MyTestServiceClient svc = <span class="kwrd">new</span> MyTestServiceClient(<span class="str">&quot;TestEndpoint&quot;</span>);
<span class="preproc">#else</span>
MyTestServiceClient svc = <span class="kwrd">new</span> MyTestServiceClient(<span class="str">&quot;RealEndpoint&quot;</span>);
<span class="preproc">#endif</span></pre>
<p>This same technique can be adapted for Astoria by flipping the service reference’s context object’s instantiation as shown below:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode"><span class="preproc">#if</span> DEBUG
<span class="kwrd">protected</span> MyEntities Context
{
get
{
<span class="kwrd">if</span> (_context == <span class="kwrd">null</span>)
_context = <span class="kwrd">new</span> MyEntities(
<span class="kwrd">new</span> Uri(<span class="str">&quot;MyService.svc&quot;</span>, UriKind.Relative));
<span class="kwrd">return</span> _context;
}
}
<span class="preproc">#else</span>
<span class="kwrd">protected</span> MyEntities Context
{
get
{
<span class="kwrd">if</span> (_context == <span class="kwrd">null</span>)
_context = <span class="kwrd">new</span> MyEntities(
<span class="kwrd">new</span> Uri(<span class="str">&quot;http://testbox/foo/MyService.svc&quot;</span>,
UriKind. Absolute));
<span class="kwrd">return</span> _context;
}
<span class="preproc">#endif</span></pre>
<p>Now simply choose the compilation options for when building and you are all set! Quite simple and effective. </p>

    <a href="/all/2009/01/12/what-do-you-develop-with.html">What Do You Develop With?</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Its been about 3.5 years for me since I last bought a PC. At the time it was a high end system and I am pretty happy that it lasted this long. In fact, I am hoping to get to 4 years with it. That may sound funny, but I have never gone past 3 years on a development ox before. This one, while not screaming anymore, has done a great job at an original cost of $2200 while many others of mine had really degraded the third year I had them. So this year I am starting to think its time to get a new PC … system is slower, 4 GB is my max RAM, its a dual core (nice but quads are much faster), and the overall specs can be blown away now with the newer systems. Plus, my wife gets a kick butt PC when I retire mine :)</p>
<p>So I’m looking at Dell, Alienware, HP, and building my own again. Probably won’t build my own even though I can spend less money and get a very nice system (done it several times), I love that when something breaks I can have a new part within 24 hours with service plans. My customers don’t want to wait for me, so the time is worth the money. That leaves Dell, HP and Alienware (any others worth looking at???) Quad core seems a must, but then the CPU choice must be made as well as Ghz speed, L2 cache, graphics card, at least 8 GB RAM, 7200 RPM SATA is likely (10,000 is nice, but too costly from what I can see). I’m looking to spend as little as possible of course, less than $2000 would be great and get 3 to 4 years out of it.</p>
<p>Not sure when I’ll pick up a new PC, but it will be sometime in 2009. I am at the beginning of the search cycle now and I’ll post what I find out and decide as I go. In the meantime, I am interested in any suggestions or questions you might have along the way.</p>
<p>So what do you develop with?</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/silverlight/2009/01/07/tip-getting-hierarchical-entities-via-ado-net-data-services-from-silverlight.html">Tip&#58; Getting Hierarchical Entities via ADO.NET Data Services from Silverlight</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>ADO.NET Data Services (hereafter called Astoria) allows simple URI mapping to entity models. Pretty cool. We can also dive into the entity model and return hierarchical data. For example, a set of Customer entities can be returned without their children or the Customer can be returned with their children (their associated Orders entities). Here are some sample syntaxes for these …</p>
<p>So the following URI would get all of the customer entities</p>
<blockquote>   <p><a title="http://[yourdomain]/NorthwindDataService.svc/customers" href="http://[yourdomain]/NorthwindDataService.svc/customers">http://[yourdomain]/NorthwindDataService.svc/customers()</a></p> </blockquote>
<p>And the following URI gets you all the customers and all of their orders:</p>
<blockquote>   <p><a title="http://[yourdomain]/NorthwindDataService.svc/customers()?$expand=orders" href="http://[yourdomain]/NorthwindDataService.svc/customers()?$expand=orders">http://[yourdomain]/NorthwindDataService.svc/customers()?$expand=orders</a>&#160;</p> </blockquote>
<p>But what if you want to get grandchild entities? For example, getting the Customers, their orders, and the order details for those orders. The following URI does not work ….</p>
<blockquote>   <p><a title="http://[yourdomain]/NorthwindDataService.svc/customers(‘ALFKI’)?$expand=orders,orderdetails" href="http://[yourdomain]/NorthwindDataService.svc/customers(&lsquo;ALFKI&rsquo;)?$expand=orders,orderdetails">http://[yourdomain]/NorthwindDataService.svc/customers(‘ALFKI’)?$expand=orders,orderdetails</a> </p> </blockquote>
<p>That will yield an error of “Type 'NorthwindModel.Customer' does not have a property named 'OrderDetails'.” When the expand keyword sees a comma delimited list, it tries to associate that entityset with the one in the URI. In other words it looks for a property on the Customers entity for Orders and one for OrderDetails. OrderDetails does not exist on the Customers (its on the Orders) so it fails. </p>
<p>So how do you get hierarchical data like this? Here is an example that works. This gets the customer ALFKI, its orders, and its orders order details. This example shows the expand keyword has 2 parameters: Orders and Orders/OrderDetails. </p>
<blockquote>   <p><a title="http://[yourdomain]/NorthwindDataService.svc/Customers(&#39;ALFKI&#39;)?$expand=Orders,Orders/OrderDetails" href="http://[yourdomain]/NorthwindDataService.svc/Customers('ALFKI')?$expand=Orders,Orders/OrderDetails">http://[yourdomain]/NorthwindDataService.svc/Customers('ALFKI')?$expand=Orders,Orders/OrderDetails</a></p> </blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, a shortcut to the previous example that also works eliminates the first parameter (the Orders) but yields the same good results of a customer, his orders and his orders’ order details. When diving into a grandchild hierarchy like this, the Orders entities are implied. In other words, since we grab the customer and we are asking for its OrderDetails, it is implied that we want the orders that connect the customers to their order details.</p>
<blockquote>   <p><a title="http://[yourdomain]/NorthwindDataService.svc/Customers(&#39;ALFKI&#39;)?$expand=Orders/OrderDetails" href="http://[yourdomain]/NorthwindDataService.svc/Customers('ALFKI')?$expand=Orders/OrderDetails">http://[yourdomain]/NorthwindDataService.svc/Customers('ALFKI')?$expand=Orders/OrderDetails</a></p> </blockquote>
<p>So we can use the comma to ask for multiple entitysets hanging off an entityset or we can use the slash to dive into a hierarchy. In Silverlight we don’t need to use the URI, we can use LINQ to specify the queries (which then get translated to the URIs).</p>
<p>Both of the following LINQ queries will get the customers, their orders and their order details. </p>
<blockquote>   <pre class="csharpcode">var query =
from c <span class="kwrd">in</span> Context.Customers.Expand(<span class="str">&quot;Orders/OrderDetails&quot;</span>)
select c;</pre>
<p>OR</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">var query =
from c <span class="kwrd">in</span> Context.Customers.Expand(<span class="str">&quot;Orders&quot;</span>).Expand(<span class="str">&quot;Orders/OrderDetails&quot;</span>)
select c;</pre>

<p>This New Years Day I received a nice gift from the Microsoft MVP award program as I was renewed as a Microsoft C# MVP again for 2009. On Jan 1 Jake, my awesome program lead, notified me that I was renewed once again. I really do enjoy being part of the MVP community. This is my 4th year in the program and the best part is that I have met a lot of great people through this program throughout our profession.</p>
<p>Congratulations to all of those who were renewed and to those who were newly awarded the MVP this time around!</p>

    <a href="/silverlight/2008/12/29/security-and-silverlight.html">Security and Silverlight</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I was reading <a href="http://programmerpayback.com/2008/12/29/ria-security-101-logins-web-services-usernames-and-passwords/#comment-38">a post by Tim Greenfield today regarding RIA and security</a>. He also followed this up <a href="http://programmerpayback.com/2008/12/29/ria-security-102-using-aspnet-session-state-to-authenticate-web-service-calls/">with a nice post</a> on how to implement one of his techniques using sessions. Taking this from the Silverlight RIA perspective this has some interesting turns. His scenarios are compelling as any information from Silverlight to the server can be sniffed out using a tool like Fiddler. So repeatedly sending credentials is not a good idea. Also, storing credentials in the hard drive of the client can have its own issues. So what to do?</p>
<p>One option Tim throws out there is a token technique. The user logs in and is handed back a token (or session ID). This can be done by assigning tokens server side with some sort of expiration on them. The token is then sent from the client to the server with each call. This can be a pain in some senses since it literally has to be sent in each call as a parameter or wrapped inside of some HTTP header, but it works. </p>
<p>Another option with Silverlight is to use Forms Authentication. The user logs into the client application and it passes their username and password to the server via some HTTP web service. The service uses Forms Authentication to check with its provider to make sure this is a valid user. If so the user is registered as a authenticated user and e s/he may proceed. One subsequent calls the server side services first check to make sure the user is authenticated (and possibly in a specific role) before allowing any call to continue. This interception of the call acts as a bouncer at the door to refuse entry from anyone not authenticated. </p>
<p>As Silverlight continues to grow, this topic is going to become more critical for many developers. I plan on producing a few materials at my site to help explain some of the options over the next few months. But for now, I recommend <a href="http://silverlight.net/learn/appcorner/adventureworkspt1.aspx?pt=1">Tim Heuer’s nice post on security</a> that shows how to do this on <a href="http://www.silverlight.net">www.silverlight.net</a> in the learning section.</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/silverlight/2008/12/20/updated-silverlight-2-datagrid-available.html">Updated Silverlight 2 DataGrid Available</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>The DataGrid has taken some heat for a few problems it has caused people in Silverlight. That’s why it is great to see an updated version of the DataGrid so quickly. This new version claims to contain almost 30 fixes to the DataGrid: One of my most awaited changes is in here too: combobox and others controls opening a popup now work as expected. If you tried to create a combobox inside a DataGrid’s cell, you may have noticed that the combobox would not stay opened. There were a few hacks out on how to make it work right, but there were all temporary fixes til this new fix came out. So needless to say, just for that fix I am thrilled :)</p>
<p>There are some great posts on what is included and instructions on how to get it and set it up.</p>
<p>Here is a <a href="http://silverlight.net/forums/t/59990.aspx">great post on what fixes were made in the DataGrid</a>, by Brian Brackel.</p>
<p>Here is the link to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=084a1bb2-0078-4009-94ee-e659c6409db0&amp;displaylang=en">get the DataGrid update (Silverlight 2 DataGrid December 2008 Release)</a>.</p>
<p>And here is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/scmorris/archive/2008/12/19/silverlight-2-datagrid-december-2008-release.aspx">another great post by Scott Morrison</a> that includes <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/scmorris/archive/2008/12/19/silverlight-2-datagrid-december-2008-release.aspx">breaking changes and installation instructions</a>. Installing it is not as simple as “download and run”. There is a bit of cleanup to get rid of the old DataGrid and replace it with the new DataGrid bits. Pretty straightforward process. I grabbed this from Scott’s post:</p>
<blockquote>   <p><strong>In order to use the new DataGrid you need to do all of the following:</strong></p>    <ol>     <li>Close all instances of Microsoft Visual Studio. </li>      <li>Delete all cached toolbox items by removing all files beginning with &quot;toolbox&quot; from %LocalAppData%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\9.0.        <ul>         <li>On Microsoft Windows XP, %LocalAppData% is Documents and Settings\<i>UserName</i>\Local Settings\Application Data. </li>          <li>On Microsoft Windows Vista, %LocalAppData% is Users\<i>UserName</i>\AppData\Local. </li>       </ul>     </li>      <li>Replace the following assemblies with the ones contained in the package in the link above:        <ul>         <li>%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft SDKs\Silverlight\v2.0\Libraries\Client\System.Windows.Controls.Data.dll </li>          <li>%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft SDKs\Silverlight\v2.0\Libraries\Client\System.Windows.Controls.Data.Design.dll </li>       </ul>     </li>      <li>For any existing projects, delete the reference to System.Windows.Controls.Data.dll and then re-add the reference. </li>   </ol></blockquote>
