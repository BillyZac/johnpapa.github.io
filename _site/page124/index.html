    <a href="/all/2008/02/01/use-the-right-tool-for-the-right-job-executescalar-or-executenonquery.html">Use the Right Tool for the Right Job - ExecuteScalar or ExecuteNonQuery</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Would you use a drill to pre-drill a hole for a nail to hang a picture? I wouldn't either. Just hammer the nail into the wall.&nbsp;OK, need something more code related? Would you define a class with a single property and no other members just to store a string? Me neither. </p>
<p>&lt;FONT color=#008000&gt;public class foo{</p>
<p>&lt;FONT color=#008000&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public string goo = "";</p>
<p>&lt;FONT color=#008000&gt;}</p>
<p>This might seem like an obvious point to most, and I sure hope it does. But recently I worked on a project that just made me think "WTF"?&nbsp; I saw some ADO.NET code that was intended to execute an UPDATE statement against a table in a SQL Server database. It worked just fine and dandy, but I had to take a second look because the code was issuing the ExecuteScalar method. At first I though, maybe the code was actually returning a value and not executing an UPDATE statement, so&nbsp;I looked at it again thinking I missed something. Nope, it was just and UPDATE statement.&nbsp; So then I wondered if the UPDATE statement was also returning a value after the UPDATE ... looked again and nope, it wasn't. This code was simply doing something like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#006400&gt;&nbsp;string sql = "UPDATE tableX SET&nbsp;columnA = value1 WHERE columnB = value2";</p>
<p>So why was this code using ExecuteScalar to run this SQL?&nbsp;I started looking around the project that I inherited and found several other places that ExecuteScalar was used ... most of which were also issuing a simple action query with no intention of getting a result back. The code looked like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#008000&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;cmd.ExecuteScalar();&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's not psuedo code, there was nothing on the left hand side to store the return value of the ExecuteScalar method. So I started to refactor the code to change the places that were using ExecuteScalar but not actually getting a return value into code like this:</p>
<p>&lt;FONT color=#008000&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();</p>
<p>Use ExecuteScalar to execute a query to return a single scalar value and use ExecuteNonQuery to execute an action query and return no values. Is this basic stuff you already know? Very likely (or hell yeah!). In fact, that is why I looked so hard when I first saw this code ... I thought, geez, I must be missing something. Like most jobs, using the right tool for the right job just makes more sense.</p>

    <a href="/all/2008/02/01/tip-side-by-side-installation-of-sql-server-2005-and-sql-server-2000.html">Tip&#58; Side by Side Installation of SQL Server 2005 and SQL Server 2000</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>&lt;FONT color=#800080&gt;Tip: when installing SQL Server, consider using named instances.</p>
<p>I recently installed SQL Server 2005&nbsp;on my&nbsp;PC.&nbsp;It went&nbsp;fairly quick and installed with 0 issues. I was also quite pleased that it&nbsp;installed very nicely side by side with a SQL Server 2000 installation already on my PC. Now when I installed SQL Server 2000 on my PC way back when, I installed it as a named instance called SQL2000. Thus, my server name is MYSERVERNAME\SQL2000 in all of my connection strings and so on. One of the nice things about installing all of your SQL Server instances as named instances is that they stay isolated from one another pretty well. </p>
<p>OK, to better demosntrate how named instances work ... For example all of my folder in the C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server directory are as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<ul> <li>\80&nbsp;&nbsp;// This folder seems to have assorted SQL 2000 files in it <li>\90&nbsp;&nbsp;// This folder seems to have assorted SQL 2005 files in it <li>\MSSQL&nbsp;&nbsp;// This folder contains SQL 2000 SQL instance's reporting services <li>\MSSQL$SQL&nbsp;// This folder contains SQL 2000's SQL instance's system files &amp; data <li>\MSSQL.1&nbsp;// This folder contains SQL 2005 system files &amp; data <li>\MSSQL.2&nbsp;// This folder contains SQL 2005 reporting services</li> <p>Notice that all of the folders are segregated from each other so that the SQL 2000 and&nbsp;SQL 2005 installation do no interfere with each other. Also, the Reporting Services installations for both 2000 and 2005 have separate virtual web sites and separate services. </p> <p>While this isn't earth shatterring news, its still pretty darn cool. I certainly don't take for granted that these products work side by side nor that Visual Studio.NET 2005 and Visual Studio.NET 2003 work side by side. I've been through too many backward incompatible and version incompatible nightmares. Side by side is a good thing. Virtual PC is nice, but side by side is better.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>We're all celebrating the recent advancements in .NET and other technologies like LINQ, XML in SQL Server and the fascinating tools like <a href="http://www.devexpress.com">CodeRush </a>and <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com">ReSharper</a>. But it struck me this week that we haven;t gone far enough in some areas ... like DHTML. For example, have you tried to write client side code in a browser application lately? I have, and its not as easy as it should be. Intellisense only bring up a portion of the actual methods and properties that the objects support and some objects don;t show up at all. Yeah, yeah, I understand the DOMs are different based on browser brands and version .. ... but what I don't agree with is how the built in tools have not progressed to the point where we get intellisense and reliable client side debugging. I have never been able to consistently get client side debugging to work on my PC. Yes, some days it works, some it doesn't. The point is that all of my server side tools are so far ahead of the curve in these matters, so why should&nbsp;I have to look up the DOM, find the object I want, then search to find some example of using it that makes sense?! I have to think someone has a tool that does this ... there is even <a href="http://www.promptsql.com/">an intellisense tool for writing T-SQL</a>.</p>
<p>I'd love to be wrong on this ... so if someone out there knows of a tool that helps with DHTML/JScript intellisense please reply to this post. I am all ears. </p>

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I had a good time at the <a href="http://www.tvug.net/">Tech Valley .NET User's Group</a> meeting last night. I presented some slides and code examples showing the new features of ADO.NET 2 as well as a demo of System.Transactions. It was a small but knowledgable group of people and I enjoyed meeting with them. Scott Stewart <a href="http://www.dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/sstewart/archive/2005/11/09/133651.aspx">gives his opinion on what he got out of the meeting at his blog</a>.</p>
<p>System.Transactions is just so cool for so many reasons. I think my favorite is in how easy it is to add transactional support at a low level that includes nesting support. There was a huge gap in&nbsp;development prior to System.Transactions in how transactions were implemented. It is a huge leap forward over options such as Enterprise Services, transactions at the DB level and ADO.NET transactions. I could go on and on, and probably will soon :-) </p>
<p>Right now I am working on revising <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/02/DataPoints/">my previous article on System.Transactions </a>that I wrote for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag">MSDN Magazine</a> with the Beta&nbsp;1 version of VS.NET 2005. There have been some great improvements made to it since then that are very worth talking about. Until then ...</p>

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Wow. Several days of anguish is finally paying off. My colleagues and I have been trying to implement a SSRS 2000&nbsp; with a web site using Forms Authentication and it is not as easy as you might think. It certainly hasn't been for us. Microsoft's own documentation is built upon Windows Integrated security which is awesome, but not always practical. They also expand on it by offerring examples on how to use Forms Authentication with SSRS 2000 by expanding on the SSRS archtitecture. Their examples aren't bad at all, actually they helped quite a bit. But they did not take us all the way home. We had to improvise on how to pass the credentials and then parse them on the SSRS side.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'll be blogging more about this fun weekend (was there a holiday to enjoy?) once I take a breather. But I wanted to get this poost out to say "Yes! You can use Forms Authentication with SSRS!!!"</p>
