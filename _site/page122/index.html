  <h2>
    <a href="/all/2008/02/01/invisible-shield-first-impressions.html">Invisible Shield - First Impressions</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I always&nbsp;put my cell phones and portable music players in my pocket. I like my devices thin and in my pocket. I just don’t like bulky belt clips that make you look like Batman. So I buy thin devices but they tend to get scratched in my pocket and dust can get under the screen. The biggest issue is the screen of these thin devices … they tend to get very dirty, scratched, or even get dust particles under them. So I started looking into finding something that would help keep the screen protected. The Q has such a crisp and bright screen that I do not want it to become blurred by fuzzy protectors. </p>
<p>I first bought some cheap disposable protectors (who shall remain nameless) from a local store and they were just horrible. I had to cut them to fit the Q (pretty easy to do) and applying a new one every week.&nbsp;It looked slightly blurry as soon as I applied it and got worse with every passing day. (It was smudged and never cleaned up well at all.) So I gave up on the inexpensive/disposable protectors and started looking for something better.</p>
<p>After doing some research, I contacted a few companies about their products so I could try them out. In this review I will be reviewing the <a href="http://www.shieldzone.com/item_description/MOTQF.html">Invisible Shield</a> (aka IS) product by <a href="http://www.shieldzone.com/">Shield Zone</a>. I chose to try the one for my new Motorola Q Smartphone since the phone is thin, looks very susceptible to scratches&nbsp;and pretty much goes everywhere with me in my pocket. There are 2 models of IS for the Motorola Q: <a href="http://www.shieldzone.com/item_description/MOTQS.html">one that fits just over the screen </a>for $9.95 and one that fits the <a href="http://www.shieldzone.com/item_description/MOTQF.html">front and the back</a> (including the screen) for $24.95. I am reviewing the front/back model.</p>
<p>I chose the IS product because it claims to be super thin, very durable, is supposedly easy to remove (just in case I don’t like it)&nbsp;and very transparent. The manufacturer (Shield Zone) also boasts a lifetime warranty on the product. I have not read the fine print yet but it looks like its covered for life. IS is a bit pricey for me as some competitors like <a href="http://www.bestskinsever.com/servlet/the-25/Motorola-Q-Total-Body/Detail">Best Skins Ever </a>(BSE) are about 1/3 the cost of the IS and get great reviews, the lifetime warranty made me give IS a shot. Most of the better products available from different companies make these protective skins for a specific phone or music player. So if you invest in one, make sure you get the one made specifically for your device.</p>
<p>OK, so I got the IS today in the mail and I took some photos of the packaging (see below). It comes with the plastic-like screens, a black squeegee, a water based solution in a spray bottle and instructions.</p>
<p>&lt;TABLE border=0&gt; &lt;TBODY&gt; &lt;TR&gt; &lt;TD&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;IMG height=273 alt=”” src=”/photos/jpapa/images/147003/425x340.aspx” width=322 border=0&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt; &lt;TD&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;IMG height=274 alt=”” src=”/photos/jpapa/images/147005/425x340.aspx” width=322 border=0&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;IMG height=398 alt=”” src=”/photos/jpapa/images/147004/340x425.aspx” width=322 border=0&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;<strong> Installation:</strong>&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Instructions said to turn off the device, remove the battery and its cover so that’s where I started. I also spent a few minutes washing my hands and cleaning the device with a soft eye glass cleaning cloth to remove grease and smudges from the Q.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Note: There is <a href="http://www.shieldzone.com/movie/install.html">a video that you can watch on their web site to show you how to install it</a>, as well. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Next I removed the shield for the battery cover off of its paper backing. There are several pieces that have to be applied, so I figured I would start with the least important to me just in case I screwed it up. I removed the IS for the battery cover, sprayed both sides of it lightly (one side is sticky) with the provided solution, and stuck it on the battery cover. Then I used the squeegee to work out the excess water and bubbles. It took me about 2 minutes for this entire step, most of which was spent working out the water and bubbles with the squeegee (gotta love that word). So far it looks pretty good. Here is a photo of my battery cover just after I installed the IS on it.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;IMG alt=”” src=”/photos/jpapa/images/147007/425x319.aspx” border=0&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;At this point you are supposed to repeat the process for the remaining IS pieces. I continued on with the back, then the front pieces and finally the screen. It took me only a few minutes to apply each piece, other than the screen protector. It took me about 30 minutes to apply the screen protector to my liking. I actually got it on in the second try (after about 5 minutes) the way I liked it but then I noticed there is a small line in the IS for the screen. So I took off the IS that was on the screen completely and sprayed it with the solution again and tried to rub off the line. I thought it might be lint at first, but after a while I realized it was not moving anywhere. I even tried running water over it in the sink and rubbing it with me fingers. It never moved. I gave up after a while realizing it was an imperfection that I was going to live with until I could contact Shield Zone and request a new screen protector. I guess I will get to try out their lifetime warranty. For now I will leave it on and see if it works itself out somehow as it “cures”. The instructions say to give it 24 hours to completely dry.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Here are some photos of the Q with the IS installed (front and back). You cannot see the imperfection in the lower left corner of the screen protector in this photo, unfortunately … but its there.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;TABLE border=0&gt; &lt;TBODY&gt; &lt;TR&gt; &lt;TD&gt;&lt;IMG alt=”” src=”/photos/jpapa/images/147008/319x425.aspx” border=0&gt;&lt;/TD&gt; &lt;TD&gt;&lt;IMG alt=”” src=”/photos/jpapa/images/147009/319x425.aspx” border=0&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt; &lt;P&gt;<strong>Wrap-Up (for now)</strong>&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;The installation was very simple for all of the pieces. The only issue I ran into was with applying the screen protector. I think there is an imperfection in it and I will contact Shield Zone and get a replacement screen protector based on the their lifetime warranty. I will follow up with my review after a few days of testing out the new IS to see how it holds up … which if course is the true test. The whole point for me is to find something that is durable, thin and barely noticeable. The Q has such a crisp and bright screen that I do not want it to become blurred by fuzzy protectors.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt; &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Overall … I am very disappointed in the appearance of the screen so far. But since there is a warranty and i can get a replacement for the screen, I will hold off on judgement on that for now. The rest of the pieces went on just fine and look good to me. The product appears to be very durable so far … I will post more after I get to use it a bit more.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;<strong></strong>&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;<strong>UPDATE (7/3/2006):</strong>&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#000000&gt; &lt;P&gt;It has been a few days since I installed the IS … its very slim and has protected my phone quite well. I purposefully put in in my pocket with coins and my cars keys and it did not scratch the phone at all. Also, I find that its easy to clean. I can rub smudges off of the screen protector easily with a lint free cloth (I use an eye glass cloth).&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;There are some things so far I am less than thrilled with, though. For example, with the IS on I can still get my Q in the desktop charger that is made for the Q. However I had to work it in the first few times. The IS makes puting the Q in the charger a bit more difficult as the IS doesn’t allow the Q to slide smoothly … instead it sticks a bit as it slides in. Once in, the Q appears to barely fit in the charger stand and I have to be careful to take it out. Its a very snug fit with the IS.  Whether its the IS that’s too thick or the stand that is to tight, who knows.
It works, but its just something to think about.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;As stated earlier, my screen protector appears to have an imperfection in it. Its a small line in the screen that I just could not remove (I thought it was lint but was wrong). The imperfection is still there and its quite annoying to have on the screen. I now also appear to have a spec of dust on the screen between the IS and the Q. it probably got in there while I as so focussed on cleaning the imperfection. Instead of taking it off and cleaning it again, i’ll wait for the replacement screen protector to arrive for Shield Zone. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Overall I am very impressed with the IS. Assuming the replacement screen protector is as clean and clear as the other pieces I received then the only issue I will have to deal with is working the Q into the charger stand smoothly. The IS is very clear so its easy to see the screen through it. Unlike other screen protectors I have had, I barely notice and fuzziness.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/all/2008/02/01/invisible-shield-3-weeks-later.html">Invisible Shield - 3 Weeks Later</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>About 3 weeks ago I began using the Invisible Shield (IS) for my Motorola Q Smartphone (see <a href="/blogs/john.papa/archive/2006/06/30/147006.aspx">my review here</a>). The one issue I had right away was that the piece that protects the screen had a&nbsp;mark on it that I could not get rid of. </p>
<p>So I contacted Shield Zone about this and they sent me a replacement screen protector. I ran into another hitch at this point ... they sent me the wrong screen protector. Let me clarify this point because its a bit odd in my opinion. The screen protector that comes with in the "screen protector" package is not the same as the one they sell in the "front and back" package. The single screen protector only covers the screen.&nbsp;The "front and back" package's screen protector covers the screen and the top front of the Q, as well. Is it a big deal? Not really. But I was unaware of this difference and could not find a reference to it on their site. So I point it out only to help any future buyers out there in case it does matter to you.</p>
<p>Anyway, the service was great at Shield Zone. They sent me the replacement piece (the wrong one). I contacted them again to let them know and they immediately sent another replacement to me. This whole process took about 2 weeks due to mailing times. I wish it was faster, but hey, it was a free replacement so&nbsp;I can live with waiting a week for a replacement.</p>
<p>They did ask me to return the damaged pieces ... which I think is silly. But again, its a small price to pay for the lifetime replacement policy.</p>
<p>I put the replacement screen on today in about 5 minutes (now that I knew how to do it better). It looks great. Very clear.</p>
<p>I have used the IS on my Q now for 3 weeks overall (I left the damaged screen on it while I waited for the new one). I have been very happy with the results. I keep my phone in my pocket and it gets banged quite a bit. I have no new scratches on the phone since I put the IS on it. I've put it in my soccer bag with my keys, in my pocket with loose change and even let me 1 year old daughter play with it (gnaw at it) and it has held up very well. Not only are there no scratches but the screen is still very clear and it is easy to clean finger prints off of it. Other screen protectors I have used were so blurry after just a few days that it drove me nuts.</p>
<p>Use your judgement when looking at this product as it is a bit more expensive than its competition. But in my opinion the product is excellent, the service is great and the lifetime warranty makes it all worth it if you want to protect your investent in your phone.</p>

    <a href="/all/2008/02/01/iis-default-web-site-wont-start.html">IIS Default Web Site Won't Start!</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>So&nbsp;I am playing around with the <a href="http://www.telerik.com/">Telerik </a>controls, the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/future/linq/">LINQ </a>preview and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/future/default.aspx">C# 3.0</a> code, some demos I am creating for the upcoming VSLive <a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/">conferences </a>and some work for my job &hellip; when all of the sudden my web site won&rsquo;t start. I rebooted my PC (the fix all solution) but it still would not start. Hmmmm. I figured it had to be something I just installed but it turned out to be something else entirely. Something I installed (or reinstalled) a few weeks ago &hellip; <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a>. </p>
<p>It turns out that <a href="http://www.skype.com/helloagain.html">Skype </a>was binding itself to my ports so IIS could not start my default web site on port 80. Now why this just started happening tonight I may never know. But thanks to <a href="http://mcosier.blogspot.com/2005/05/service-could-not-bind-instance-1.html">a post I found on Matthew Cosier&rsquo;s Blog</a> it pointed me to <a href="http://www.skype.com/helloagain.html">Skype</a>.</p>
<p>As soon as I went into the options of <a href="http://www.skype.com/helloagain.html">Skype </a>and went to view the connection settings, I unchecked the checkbox that allows <a href="http://www.skype.com/helloagain.html">Skype </a>to use port 80 and 443. I then shut <a href="http://www.skype.com/helloagain.html">Skype </a>down and turned it back on and all was well. My web site started just fine this time. I like <a href="http://www.skype.com/helloagain.html">Skype</a>, but man that is annoying. Thankfully a quick <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google </a>search found Matthew&rsquo;s post and i only lost about 15 minutes of time. I&rsquo;m reposting it so future victims will have double the chances to get a hit on <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>.</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/all/2008/02/01/flexiskin-review-for-the-motorola-q.html">FlexiSkin Review for the Motorola Q</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I own a Motorola Q Smartphone (which I love) and I wanted to protect it against drops.&nbsp;In the past I have occasionally dropped my cell phones and been pretty lucky that they have not been severely damaged.&nbsp;In fact, 1 week after owning the Q I dropped it in the kitchen&nbsp;on the&nbsp;floor and the case flew off, the battery few out&nbsp;… I got very lucky that all was still well.&nbsp;So I decided it was time to get something to protect my Q. (Plus, I have a 1 year old daughter who just love to carry it around the house so it helps to have drop protection.)</p>
<p>I carry my&nbsp;Smartphone in my pants pocket&nbsp;so I needed a case to be thin but durable. I was not looking for something big and bulky but rather something that would handle the occasional drop. I considered getting a leather or plastic case, and while there are certainly some very nice ones out there, I felt they were all too bulky to carry in my pocket. It seems that most cases are meant to be strapped on your pants or on your belt. </p>
<p>In my search, I ran across <a href="http://www.boxwave.com/products/flexiskin/flexiskin-motorola-q_869.htm">a product called FlexiSkin</a> made by <a href="http://www.boxwave.com/index.htm">Boxwave</a>. <a href="http://www.boxwave.com/index.htm">Boxwave </a>makes cases for several products including cell phones, Smartphones, cameras and portable music players. They have a <a href="http://www.boxwave.com/products/flexiskin/flexiskin-motorola-q_869.htm">FlexiSkin </a>designed specifically for the Q so I decided to give it a try. The <a href="http://www.boxwave.com/products/flexiskin/flexiskin-motorola-q_869.htm">FlexiSkin </a>appears to be made of a rubbery/silicone like substance that is soft to touch, stretches and seems durable enough to sustain light drops and bumps.</p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Options:</strong></p>
<p>They offer the FlexiSkin in several colors, so if you are in to that you have some options. For me, I just wanted something subtle so I chose the clear/frosted skin color. They have photos of all of the skins on their web site so you can see what the colors look like.</p>
<p>The skins for the Q also come either with or without a keyboard cover. I like my keyboard to be completely unobstructed so&nbsp;I chose to get a skin that did not cover the keyboard. My purpose for the skin is to protect against minor drops. If the Q drops, the keyboard is the least of my worries. I am mostly concerned with the edges and a little bit of a barrier on the front and back to absorb the impact. In any event, they have the fully covered keyboard as an option for those who are interested.</p>
<p>If you want the fully covered keyboard and are concerned about being able to press your keys accurately, I would not worry too much. In the model I chose the keyboard was not covered however the menu buttons and the D-Pad are covered by the skin. I thought this might be a problem to accurately press the buttons (or to see them through the skin), however&nbsp;I was wrong. Pressing the D-Pad and the menu buttons through the skin is quite easy and in some cases makes it easier to find the button since it has a bit of a tactile feel to it. I cannot say for certain if the keyboard cover offers this same textured approach for the keys since I did not try that model, however.</p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Installation:</strong></p>
<p>The FlexiSkin comes with&nbsp;2 parts: the skin and a strap. I have no desire to attach the strap to my Q’s skin however if you do, the strap appears to be able to be connected to the skin or the Q with a loop like most straps. I left the strap off since&nbsp;I have no need for it. The skin itself is very soft and very flexible. </p>
<p>Here is the skin on its own. It has several cutouts that align very well with the Q. There are large cutouts for the screen and the keyboard as well as several smaller cutouts for the microphone, speaker, track wheel,&nbsp;USB&nbsp;slot, miniSD slot, headphone jack, camera lens and camera flash.&nbsp; They all lined up very closely with the corresponding parts of the Q for me.</p>
<p>&lt;IMG alt="" src="/photos/jpapa/images/147982/original.aspx" border=0&gt;<br /></p>
<p>The&nbsp;skin has a nice amount of stretch to it. <br />&lt;IMG alt="" src="/photos/jpapa/images/147977/original.aspx" border=0&gt; </p>
<p>Installing the skin is easy enough. I pushed the bottom of the Q through screen cutout in the skin. The skin gently stretched and I slid the Q all the way into the bottom. It made a nice tight fit and slid quite easily. Then I stretched the top of the skin over each corner of the Q. Not knowing how much stretch there is to the skin, I was careful not to pull too hard nor to pull on a small piece at the top. I have heard some others users of the skin mention that their’s had torn on the top. I am happy to report that my skin has not torn even after about 5 weeks of constant use where I put it on and take it off almost every day. However, I can easily see how the skin might tear if pulled to hard, so I plan on being careful to pull on larger pieces. </p>
<p>&lt;TABLE border=0&gt; &lt;TBODY&gt; &lt;TR&gt; &lt;TD&gt;&lt;IMG alt=”” src=”/photos/jpapa/images/147978/original.aspx” border=0&gt;&lt;/TD&gt; &lt;TD&gt;&lt;IMG alt=”” src=”/photos/jpapa/images/147979/original.aspx” border=0&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt; &lt;TR&gt; &lt;TD&gt;&lt;IMG alt=”” src=”/photos/jpapa/images/147980/original.aspx” border=0&gt;&lt;/TD&gt; &lt;TD&gt;&lt;IMG alt=”” src=”/photos/jpapa/images/147981/original.aspx” border=0&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt; &lt;P&gt; &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;<strong>Usage:</strong>&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;The skin has a nice feel to it. Its soft and smooth, yet it is not so smooth that its slippery. It has a slight textured feel to it that is not sticky. When I go out I put the Q inside the FlexiSkin and put it in my pants pocket. I dropped it 3 times from about 3 feet as a test. I figured that was generally about the height that it would slip out of my hand when putting it in or out of my pocket. The FlexiSkin hit the floor first, absorbing most of the impact and preserving the Q. There were no issues with the Q (unlike the time it flew into 3 pieces when I dropped the Q without any protective skin). Its still thin enough where it is not obtrusive in my pocket, too.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;One complaint I have with the skin is that although it still keeps the Q very think and adds very little bulk, it does add just enough bulk that the Q does not fit into the cradle while the skin is on it OK, this might be an obvious point, but I was hoping that I could get it in the cradle still. Its not a big issue as I imagine that the Q would have to be removed from any case before putting it in the cradle. So when i charge my Q, I either plug it in directly to the USB charger cable or I remove the Q from the skin and put the Smartphone in the cradle without the skin. Again, not a huge issue, but it would be nice.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;<strong></strong> &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;<strong>Overall:</strong>&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;I would not recommend it for rain protection nor to protect against throwing it against a wall nor to protect against driving a car over it. (Yes, some cases do claim to offer these features.) Overall I am happy with the FlexiSkin. It has a nice feel to it, does not make it difficult to press the buttons, adds very little bulk to the Q, and appears to absorb the impact of the occasional drop. Some users have reported that it is prone to tears around the top where the skin is thinner, however I did not experience that after several weeks of putting it on and off 5 days a week. I recommend taking a look at FlexiSkin if you are in the market for a skin for your device.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt; &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;<strong>UPDATE:</strong>&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;I received a question from a few readers regarding whether the skin will fit even with the extended battery in the Motorola Q. The answer is yes, but not nearly as snug as with the standard battery. But yes, the skin stretches over the extra girth of the Q with the extended battery.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt; &lt;/P&gt;</p>

    <p>The latest <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=1e902c21-340c-4d13-9f04-70eb5e3dceea&amp;displaylang=en">LINQ CTP</a> is now up on the MSDN public web site <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=1e902c21-340c-4d13-9f04-70eb5e3dceea&amp;displaylang=en">right here</a>. Some of the new features are pretty cool including the JOIN syntax and its enhancements and LINQ over ADO.NET DataSets. Lucky for me it came out just in time for me to be able to demonstrate some of its features next week in my <a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2006/orlando/workshops.aspx#7">full day Data Access workshop </a>at the <a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2006/orlando/">Orlando VSLive</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve been really enjoying the new features. Still a ways to go, but it looks great so far!</p>
