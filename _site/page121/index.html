    <p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/12/default.aspx">December 2006 issue of MSDN Magazine</a>&nbsp;is now posted online. My latest <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/12/DataPoints/">Data Points</a> column discusses development with the SmartPhone (titled &quot;RSS Feeds on a Smartphone&quot;). Here is a excerpt from the article quoted from the introduction:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>This month I will demonstrate how to build a Windows Mobile<sup class="clsSmall">&reg;</sup> 5.0 application that reads RSS feeds and loads them into an ADO.NET DataSet. I will start out by showing how to request an RSS feed from a URL asynchronously and then demonstrate how to read the RSS feed and load it into a DataSet. Next, I will show you how to navigate the DataSet&#39;s hierarchy to find the appropriate data containing each feed&#39;s items. Then I will discuss how to use anonymous delegates to sort the data, how to check for the existence of a field in the RSS data using ADO.NET, and how to use the WebBrowser control to navigate to a URL or display HTML. Finally, I will demonstrate how to deploy the application to a mobile device using a CAB project. The full source code for this sample application is available from the MSDN<sup class="clsSmall">&reg;</sup>Magazine Web site.</em></p>

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I've been using Resharper 2 since it was released and its been getting slower for me. What I mean is when&nbsp;I type the characters do not appear as fast as I type. The wierd thing is that it seems to be getting worse. Today it just go unbearable. i cannot be productive with the huge delay in typing that i am getting right now. I tried builds 248 - 252 for VS.NET 2005 and each one gives me the slowness.</p>
<p>For now,&nbsp;I uninstalled the product until I can do some debugging and/o research with JetBrains. Resharper is an awesome tool and I feel like I am cutting of my right arm and trying to code without it, but it just got to be to darn slow. I'll be contacting them soon to see what else I can try.</p>
<p>So my point for rambling on is to see if any of you have already been down this road with Resharper 2 and to what conclusion you came. How have your experiences been?</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/all/2008/02/01/practical-net-2-amp-c-2-first-impressions.html">Practical .NET 2 & C# 2 - First Impressions</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I got my copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0976613220/104-1043296-1707162?v=glance&amp;n=283155">Practical .NET 2 and C# 2</a> about a month ago and with my reading list as it is, I have bouncing around between several books. Some good, some bad and some in between.&nbsp;So I finally got to reading a good chunk of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0976613220/104-1043296-1707162?v=glance&amp;n=283155">Practical .NET 2 and C# 2 </a>by <a href="http://www.practicaldot.net/en2/main.htm">Patrick Smacchia </a>(the 10 first chapters) and it certainly has its moments. So far I have found it to be a very good book that makes may dry topics move very quickly.</p>
<p>The publisher is Paradoxal Press … a virtual unknown in our industry. And I believe this is their first book in the .NET development space. With that said, overall I have no major complaints about how the book is put together. There are several grammatical errors in the book that I believe should have been caught by the editors, but this is a minor issue. </p>
<p>The author, Patrick Smacchia, is a Microsoft MVP and he touches on a wide variety of topics in this book.&nbsp;I as very skeptical at first seeing that the book covers so much of .NET … I was afraid it was another one of those books that discusses everything but at such a high level it leaves you wanting at every turn of the page. This book is over 800 pages and through the first 10 chapters I have found it to be very interesting as it discusses the .NET framework and its foundation. Much of this may be a review to many readers, but I found that I did not want to skip pages to quickly just in case there was something new I could pick up on a topic I was already familiar with. Despite its density,&nbsp;I have found the book fast moving so far. </p>
<p>I like the way the author explains topics, very direct and to the point. He general describes a topic, why the topic is important, where it is useful and then gives examples on who to use it. This is a not a editorial book like some others I have read lately ... the author is more focussed on explaining&nbsp; .NET than he is on amusing the reader. Perhaps this is why it reads so fast.</p>
<p>Up through chapter 10 the book has focussed on the .NET Framework v2 and the basics of objects in .NET. The rest of the book gets more into the features such as generics, ADO.NET, remoting, polymorhpism, inheritance, base classes, and transactions. So far this book strikes me as a good reference to explain how things work in .NET both under the covers and on the surface. This book lacks practical everyday examples on using may features (so far, thru chapter 10) and instead focuses on explaining what the features are, how they work and where they might be used. This is not a flaw of the book but rather a categorization of it. We sometimes buy books as a reference and other times we buy them for specific problems that we want to solve. This book falls in the former category. </p>
<p>I recommend this to any .NET developer who wants to fill in the gaps and get&nbsp;a solid understanding of the .NET Framework v2. For someone who has written all or parts of 8 books I am impressed with Patrick’s ability to keep the topics flowing along at a pace that both maintains the interest of the reader and manages to get deep enough into each topic. Through chapter 10, this book gets 4 stars out of 5 for me.</p>

    <a href="/all/2008/02/01/motorola-q-smartphone.html">Motorola Q Smartphone</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I did it ... I admit it. I was one of the many silly people that got hyped up on the just released Motorola Q Smartphone. (It runs the Windows Mobile 5 OS&nbsp; … the Smartphone edition). My contract was up and I was itching for a new phone/pda. I was debating over the Treo 700w, Treo 700p and the Motorola Q. In the end the Q won out with me because of it form factor and phone first mentality. Although, a colleague of mine let me play with his Treo 700w quite a bit (thanks Brian) and i have to admit that there is very little NOT to like about it either.</p>
<p>I have been using this thing for 3 days now and I am very impressed. Oh, it has its quirks, but it is a very impressive phone.</p>
<p>The biggest complaint I have is that it only comes from Verizon … which in my area means no high speed wireless connection. I do not get their EVDO service where I am, but I was surprised to see the standard CDMA network in my area gives me 100k to 200k … so its still snappy enough for the time being. Cingular is better in my area for data, and they were surely get the Q and probably the Treo before the end of 2006 (I don't know for sure, but I would think they would **gulp**).</p>
<p>&lt;IMG src="/photos/jpapa/images/146052/secondarythumb.aspx" border=0&gt;</p>
<p>What drew me too the Q? Well a few of the things are ….</p>
<ul> <li>– It is as thin as the RAZR.&nbsp;I love how thin this thing is! I can slip it in and out of my pocket, no holster required! <li>– It has a QWERTY keyboard. Typing emails on a number pad is just a horrific experience. <li>– It offers the basics for me: email, IM, and phone … and it does them all very well <li>– The phone quality is excellent. This is a phone first and it shows. <li>– It can stream video or TV. Nuff said for the geek in me. <li>– It handles MP3’s and MPEG4 videos quite nicely on a miniSD card.</li> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>What caused my hesitation?</p> <ul> <li>– Motorola is not known for making good Smartphones nor PDA’s. <li>– This phone has been delayed several times. <li>– There is no GSM version … yet <li>– Verizon is expensive with their data plans, IMO <li>– Software for the Smartphone is harder to find than Pocket PC <li>– The Q has a landscape screen. Very cool, but again, less software supports it capably</li> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I’ll discuss more about what I like and what I don’t as I use it. And for those mobile developers out there, you can check out my upcoming “<a href="/blogs/john.papa/archive/2006/06/04/146047.aspx">Smartphone Skills</a>” blog post series.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>&lt;A href="/photos/jpapa/images/146052/original.aspx" target=_blank&gt;

    <p><a href="/blogs/john.papa/archive/2006/06/20/146617.aspx">2 days ago I posted about my frustrating experiences with Resharper v2</a>,&nbsp;specifically&nbsp;how when I type there is a delay in characters appearing. It was really slowing me down and causing me to stop and repeat my steps. I sent a note to <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/">JetBrains </a>support and sent them a sample project of mine so they could try to repeat it. The project was small with only a handful of files. The files were all small too.</p>
<p>This morning I got a message from them saying that they were able to reproduce the problem and are working on a solution. Its not fixed yet, but I am impressed with the quick responses and service that I have received from their support team. Hopefully the fix will be out soon, too.</p>

    <p>If you are interested in System.Transactions, I'll be doing a MSDN WebCast next week on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/events/EventDetails.aspx?CMTYSvcSource=MSCOMMedia&amp;Params=%7eCMTYDataSvcParams%5e%7earg+Name%3d%22ID%22+Value%3d%221032295237%22%2f%5e%7earg+Name%3d%22ProviderID%22+Value%3d%22A6B43178-497C-4225-BA42-DF595171F04C%22%2f%5e%7earg+Name%3d%22lang%22+Value%3d%22en%22%2f%5e%7earg+Name%3d%22cr%22+Value%3d%22US%22%2f%5e%7esParams%5e%7e%2fsParams%5e%7e%2fCMTYDataSvcParams%5e">Using System.Transactions in .NET 2.0</a>. The WebCast is on May 31st, at 9:00am Pacific Time. (That's 12 noon for us on the East Coast). Here is a brief&nbsp; summary of the agenda:</p>
<p>&lt;BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style=”MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px”&gt; &lt;P&gt;The Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 includes the System.Transactions namespace, which enhances transactional support for managed code. This webcast discusses how System.Transactions can handle transactions without deriving from a ServicedComponent, using interception or reflection. Designed to integrate with Microsoft SQL Server 2005, System.Transactions supports promotion of local lightweight to fully distributed transactions. We illustrate this using examples that modify default transactional settings as well as the isolation level, timeout period, and transaction context. We also demonstrate several examples of using transactions and when and if they are promoted.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt; &lt;P dir=ltr&gt;  Hope to “see” you there!&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P dir=ltr&gt; &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P dir=ltr&gt;PS … I will likely be doing some other WebCast’s this summer and i will post them once they are scheduled.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P dir=ltr&gt; &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P dir=ltr&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/FONT&gt; I included the sample codin the downlink below this post. Thanks for attending!&lt;/P&gt;</p>
