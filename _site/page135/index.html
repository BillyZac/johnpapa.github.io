  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>We all make mistakes ... I know I certainly do. Today I made one that only set me back about 10 minutes ... but I admit I felt silly after I realized what I did wrong. Today I created a new VS 2008 project, added an Entity Data model (aka EDMX file) to the project, and began setting up my EDM. When i went to build the project I received a ton of errors about invalid references. So I checked my references folder and bam! ... several dll's were marked is invalid.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/InvalidReferencesinEntityFramework_D557/image_6.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="244" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/InvalidReferencesinEntityFramework_D557/image_thumb_2.png" width="214" border="0" /></a> </p>
<p>The quick and easy solution to this problem was that I forgot to set the target framework of my project to .NET Framework 3.5. </p>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Just published is my article on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/08/02/DataPoints/default.aspx">Designing an Entity Data Model</a> with the Entity Framework tools. This article is part of my <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/08/02/DataPoints/default.aspx">Data Points column</a> in the February issue of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/08/02">MSDN Magazine</a>. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/07/07/DataPoints/">A few months ago I wrote an article discussing an overview of the Entity Framework</a> and examining the CSDL, SSDL, and MSL that defines the EDM. When that article was published the tools were not available, so in this article I&nbsp; decided to explain how the tools work which coincides nicely with the previous article's explanation of the XML files (CSDL, SSDL, MSL). The EDM designer sits&nbsp; on top of the XML files and uses the XML information to represent the model. Likewise, the model can be changed using the designer tools which then updates the XML under the covers.</p>
<p>I will be having a few more articles in the upcoming months that explain more about the Entity Framework and its auxiliary parts. For next month's issue I plan on going through many of the Standard Query Operators that can be used with LINQ to objects/entities. Also, if you are planning on <a href="http://www.devconnections.com/?refer=juliaL">attending DevConnections in Orlando in the Spring</a> (this April), I will be presenting 2 different 1:15 minute sessions on the Entity Framework there as well.</p>
<p>As always, if you want to review my history of articles, please visit <a href="/articles/">my articles history page</a> where you can find them all listed.</p>

<p>I enjoy writing mobile device applications. Especially when I can combine modern architectural patterns that I use in most enterprise applications to mobile devices, as well. My latest article, titled "<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/08/01/DataPoints/">Accessing Data From a Mobile Application</a>" is now available online in the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/08/01">January MSDN Magazine</a> issue. </p>

<p>Here is a summary of the article:</p>
<p>Data access is an important aspect of developing applications with the Microsoft<sup>®</sup> .NET Compact Framework for Windows Mobile<sup>®</sup> devices. By using the existing architecture to send and receive data between your mobile application and your application server, you can pass data with either DataSets, custom objects, or scalar values.  <p>In this installment of DataPoints, I will discuss best practices for data access strategies when developing mobile applications for Smartphones. I will also demonstrate how to design a data-driven Smartphone application that can display and save data over the Internet. I will show you how to communicate with a server application that exposes methods to get data using a DataSet, custom objects, and a generic List&lt;T&gt; of entities.

  <h2>
    <a href="/all/2007/12/22/book-review-linq-quickly.html">Book Review - LINQ Quickly</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I had a chance this week to breeze through a new <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/linq-quick-starter/book">book titled LINQ Quickly</a>. It is published by Packt Publishing and written by N. Shateesh Kumar. The book is about 225 pages long and is focuses on how to use LINQ with various&nbsp; targets. First I will review how the chapters flow then I will give my overall impression of the book.</p>
<p>The book starts out with a brief&nbsp; look at what the .NET 3.5 features are in regards to the basis of LINQ. Items such as object initializers, collection initializers, lambda expressions, and expression trees are given a few pages each to explain what they are. This is a nice overview of the features but it does not touch enough on when or where you would or would not want to use these features. </p>
<p>The book then flows into using LINQ with objects. This is a very short chapter on how to use LINQ with arrays and other list based objects. The following chapters flow through LINQ to XML, LINQ to XSD, LINQ to SQL and LINQ to DataSets. These chapters all focus on how to use LINQ with the technologies, respectively. Its a nice primer on how to do so, but there is very little meat to it. </p>
<p>The latter chapters are basically a reference for many of the LINQ query expression methods. It gives a nice quick hit list of each method, what it does and an example of how to use it. This is very MSDN like but it is a very nice consolidated list of features with quick examples. For example, this is a nice section or those wanting to know what SelectMany does and how to write the syntax to use it.</p>
<p>The entire book is a great quickstart or reference but if you are looking for practical applications for LINQ, you will likely be left wanting. I recommend this book to those looking for an easy and fast read that can get you an idea of what LINQ can do and how to write the syntax. It is also good for those more experienced with LINQ who are looking for a quick reference to look up how to use LINQ in certain ways as a refresher. I would not recommend this book to anyone looking for when and where to use LINQ. Also, LINQ to Entities is very absent in this book as there is minimal material on on using LINQ with the Entity Framework.</p>
<p>I recommend this book to beginners to LINQ those looking for a quick reference on LINQ itself. It works well in that area. If you are looking for more depth, then I suggest looking at some of the other titles out or arriving soon.</p>

    <a href="/all/2007/12/21/moving-to-graffiti.html">Moving to Graffiti</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Today I started the migration of my web site and blog to <a href="http://www.telligent.com">Telligent's</a> new tool, <a href="http://www.graffiticms.com">Graffiti</a>. You can check out the latest news on Graffiti at www.graffiticms.com . It is currently in beta, but has some very interesting features. I am sure to go through some growing pains with it as its full release version is due to come out in January&nbsp; 2008, but so far it has been pretty smooth. </p>
<p>I took a theme that <a href="www.richmercer.com">Rich Mercer</a> created and I tweaked it a bit. He wrote the stylized theme of which I changed some of the styles, images and colors just a wee bit. The result of those change are what you see here on this site.</p>
<p>There is not a lot of information around on how to customize Graffiti yet, although I expect a lot will be as times moves on. That is the bad news. But the good news is that it is very simple and QUICK to get up and running. I added a few customizations to the site including some static pages in the navigation bar as well. I found a <a href="http://richmercer.com/blog/customizing-a-post-layout-in-graffiti/">few posts on Rich's site that point out how to do this</a>.</p>
<p>So now I have to migrate all of my posts from <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/john.papa/default.aspx">CodeBetter.com</a> over to my site on Graffiti. Jayme <a href="http://ndepth.net/blog/graffiti-migrator/">Davis has put together a migration tool</a> to do just that. I plan on giving that a try this weekend.</p>
<p>So please bear with the process. I expect that I will be making a lot of changes over the next month until everything is hooked up and ready to go. I will be cross posting to both CodeBetter.com and <a href="/">johnpapa.net</a></p>

  <div>
    
    
    <p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/diego/">Diego Vega</a> started me thinking about the differences between the different API's to the Entity Framework. I am currently doing a lot of writing about the Entity Framework and preparing many sessions on the topic so it obviously interests me :).&nbsp; I had asked Diego about some of the differences between Entity SQL and using the strongly typed syntax of LINQ. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/diego/archive/2007/12/20/some-differences-between-esql-and-linq-to-entities-capabilities.aspx">He posted a quick list</a> of some of the differences and similarities in <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/diego/archive/2007/12/20/some-differences-between-esql-and-linq-to-entities-capabilities.aspx">this post</a> today. (Thanks Diego)</p>
<p>That's a nice hit list of differences. I had not thought about how you can navigate with Entity SQL even without a Navigation property. Going further on this train of thought I figured I would post my interpretation of a similar question I get from people a lot.</p>
<p><strong>In what situations would I choose 1 over the other? </strong></p>
<p>The options being:</p>
<ol> <li>Entity SQL with Entity Client  <li>Entity SQL with Object Services  <li>LINQ with Object Services </li> <p>This is obviously an involved question/answer as the situation has to take into account several factors to make that determination. But overall here is a high level barometer you can use: </p> <ul> <li>Entity SQL with Entity Client  <ul> <li>when you need to read data and not write to it  <li>when you need dynamic queries </li> <li>Entity SQL with Object Services  <ul> <li>when you need to retrieve entities you can interact with and persist, using a dynamic query </li></ul> <li>LINQ with Object Services  <ul> <li>when you need to retrieve entities you can interact with and persist, using strongly typed syntax </li></ul></li> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I intentionally left this post very short as a means to help those who are just trying to wade through the deluge of information that is available on the Entity Framework. My general style is to keep blog posts to a quick and easily digestible piece of information. Deep dark details of topics I usually reserve for articles as I know personally when I read a blog post that goes on and on I start to lose focus ... which means I have a short attention span :)</p>

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I recently took the plunge on purchasing a tablet PC. I wanted something light, very portable, powerful, long battery life and it had to be a tablet PC. I spent months researching and tinkering with samples before I finally decide on the Lenovo Thinkpad X61. I looked at the Fujitsu, HP, Toshiba and even the upcoming Dell tablets but overall the Thinkpad won me over. I'll give my feedback on the tablet after I get it and put it through the ringer, but if you are interested in a Lenovo product, i suggest using one of their coupon codes. They always seem to run some kind of deal and as of 11/21/2007 they have $495 off plus a stackable coupon code of USPSAVE1DAY which i think expires Nov 22nd, 2007. This coupon claims to save you another 20%. The coupons expire all the time and a new one seems to pop up. Can I guarantee it ... of course not ... but my point is that even though it seems to be on the high pricey end, they always have a discount and/or coupon of some sorts to bring it back down to affordable levels.</p>

    <a href="/all/2007/12/21/wpf-data-binding.html">WPF Data Binding</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>My <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/07/12/DataPoints/">December column of Data Points</a> has just been released and is now available <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/07/12/DataPoints/">online</a>. This month I discuss WPF data binding techniques, which are a huge improvement over previous data binding strategies. I included some code samples for demonstration purposes with the article as well.</p>
<p>Here is a short intro to the article ...</p>
<p>By now, many of you know that WPF makes it easy to design robust user interfaces. But what you probably didn't know is that it also provides powerful data-binding capabilities. With WPF you can perform data manipulation using Microsoft<sup>®</sup> .NET Framework code, XAML, or a combination of both. You can bind to controls, public properties, XML, or objects, making data binding quick, flexible, and easier than ever.
