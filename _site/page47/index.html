    <a href="/silverlight/2008/12/29/security-and-silverlight.html">Security and Silverlight</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I was reading <a href="http://programmerpayback.com/2008/12/29/ria-security-101-logins-web-services-usernames-and-passwords/#comment-38">a post by Tim Greenfield today regarding RIA and security</a>. He also followed this up <a href="http://programmerpayback.com/2008/12/29/ria-security-102-using-aspnet-session-state-to-authenticate-web-service-calls/">with a nice post</a> on how to implement one of his techniques using sessions. Taking this from the Silverlight RIA perspective this has some interesting turns. His scenarios are compelling as any information from Silverlight to the server can be sniffed out using a tool like Fiddler. So repeatedly sending credentials is not a good idea. Also, storing credentials in the hard drive of the client can have its own issues. So what to do?</p>
<p>One option Tim throws out there is a token technique. The user logs in and is handed back a token (or session ID). This can be done by assigning tokens server side with some sort of expiration on them. The token is then sent from the client to the server with each call. This can be a pain in some senses since it literally has to be sent in each call as a parameter or wrapped inside of some HTTP header, but it works. </p>
<p>Another option with Silverlight is to use Forms Authentication. The user logs into the client application and it passes their username and password to the server via some HTTP web service. The service uses Forms Authentication to check with its provider to make sure this is a valid user. If so the user is registered as a authenticated user and e s/he may proceed. One subsequent calls the server side services first check to make sure the user is authenticated (and possibly in a specific role) before allowing any call to continue. This interception of the call acts as a bouncer at the door to refuse entry from anyone not authenticated. </p>
<p>As Silverlight continues to grow, this topic is going to become more critical for many developers. I plan on producing a few materials at my site to help explain some of the options over the next few months. But for now, I recommend <a href="http://silverlight.net/learn/appcorner/adventureworkspt1.aspx?pt=1">Tim Heuer’s nice post on security</a> that shows how to do this on <a href="http://www.silverlight.net">www.silverlight.net</a> in the learning section.</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/silverlight/2008/12/20/updated-silverlight-2-datagrid-available.html">Updated Silverlight 2 DataGrid Available</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>The DataGrid has taken some heat for a few problems it has caused people in Silverlight. That’s why it is great to see an updated version of the DataGrid so quickly. This new version claims to contain almost 30 fixes to the DataGrid: One of my most awaited changes is in here too: combobox and others controls opening a popup now work as expected. If you tried to create a combobox inside a DataGrid’s cell, you may have noticed that the combobox would not stay opened. There were a few hacks out on how to make it work right, but there were all temporary fixes til this new fix came out. So needless to say, just for that fix I am thrilled :)</p>
<p>There are some great posts on what is included and instructions on how to get it and set it up.</p>
<p>Here is a <a href="http://silverlight.net/forums/t/59990.aspx">great post on what fixes were made in the DataGrid</a>, by Brian Brackel.</p>
<p>Here is the link to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=084a1bb2-0078-4009-94ee-e659c6409db0&amp;displaylang=en">get the DataGrid update (Silverlight 2 DataGrid December 2008 Release)</a>.</p>
<p>And here is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/scmorris/archive/2008/12/19/silverlight-2-datagrid-december-2008-release.aspx">another great post by Scott Morrison</a> that includes <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/scmorris/archive/2008/12/19/silverlight-2-datagrid-december-2008-release.aspx">breaking changes and installation instructions</a>. Installing it is not as simple as “download and run”. There is a bit of cleanup to get rid of the old DataGrid and replace it with the new DataGrid bits. Pretty straightforward process. I grabbed this from Scott’s post:</p>
<blockquote>   <p><strong>In order to use the new DataGrid you need to do all of the following:</strong></p>    <ol>     <li>Close all instances of Microsoft Visual Studio. </li>      <li>Delete all cached toolbox items by removing all files beginning with &quot;toolbox&quot; from %LocalAppData%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\9.0.        <ul>         <li>On Microsoft Windows XP, %LocalAppData% is Documents and Settings\<i>UserName</i>\Local Settings\Application Data. </li>          <li>On Microsoft Windows Vista, %LocalAppData% is Users\<i>UserName</i>\AppData\Local. </li>       </ul>     </li>      <li>Replace the following assemblies with the ones contained in the package in the link above:        <ul>         <li>%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft SDKs\Silverlight\v2.0\Libraries\Client\System.Windows.Controls.Data.dll </li>          <li>%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft SDKs\Silverlight\v2.0\Libraries\Client\System.Windows.Controls.Data.Design.dll </li>       </ul>     </li>      <li>For any existing projects, delete the reference to System.Windows.Controls.Data.dll and then re-add the reference. </li>   </ol></blockquote>

Of course, code samples will be available from <a href="http://www.silverlight-data.com">www.silverlight-data.com</a>&#160; and from O’Reilly’s site, too.</p>
<p>For now, you can find the code samples for the book in my&#160; l<img title="image" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; border-right-width: 0px" height="180" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/NowAvailableDataDrivenServiceswithSilver_C7C9/image_8.png" width="260" align="right" border="0" />inks section. Just go to <a href="http://www.silverlight-data.com">www.silverlight-data.com</a> and scroll down on the right hand site and look for “Links”. You see it listed in there.</p>

    <a href="/all/2008/12/17/early-peek-at-resharper-4-5-features.html">Early Peek at Resharper 4.5 Features</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>From the JetBrains web site I grabbed this info below that explains the latest features that the next release of Resharper should have. I love this tool, personally. I’ve tried many refactoring tools and this is the only one that does not get in my way, is easy enough to learn, and offers me a big productivity boost. Now obviously everyone is different in how they like to code … some don’t&#160; like these tools at all, and some like others tools like Refactor Pro and Code Rush. Those are nice tools too, in fact I love their templates and their eye candy visuals. Its a great competition between these 2 tools, I love revisiting it each year and seeing who is better for me. R# has some great features for refactoring XAML in WPF and Silverlight too.</p>
<blockquote>   <p><img title="image" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="93" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/EarlyPeekatResharper4.5Features_130B1/image_3.png" width="106" align="left" border="0" />We're boosting performance in version 4.5 – ReSharper will feel like it's been turbocharged! </p>    <p>We are also unveiling a fascinating feature that deserves a special mention: Solution-Wide Analysis. In addition to the current abilities to detect errors in your entire solution, ReSharper 4.5 enables you to identify unused code, excessive access rights, overly specific types and such on. </p>    <p>Other feature highlights of ReSharper 4.5 include: </p>    <ul>     <li>Better Visual Basic support: our cross-language refactorings and editing experience enhancements will better support VB code </li>      <li>New refactorings </li>      <li>Enhanced setup for naming conventions, which will be supported by all ReSharper features </li>      <li>Multiple new productivity enhancements </li>   </ul>    <p>We expect first public builds of ReSharper 4.5 to be available by the end of the year, Q1'2009 bringing the release. And the upgrade will be free for ReSharper 4.0 customers. </p></blockquote>

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Today was supposed to be the geekSpeek webcast for my ADO.NET Data Services and Silverlight topic …. however … life took a detour. <img title="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; margin: 5px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="193" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/WhenLifeTakesaDetour_F0E4/image_6.png" width="200" align="left" border="0" /> </p>
<p>This morning my family had a little scare and I had to rush to the hospital when my unborn son decided to shake things up a bit. Both mom and the baby are doing fine after hours&#160; and yes we convinced him to stay inside for what we hope is another 11 weeks when she is due. We were very touched by all of he emails, text messages and tweets we received from so many people today. Thank you all very much for the thoughts, kind words and prayers.</p>
<p>Back off the detour … I apologize for the postponement of the geekSpeek webcast and I appreciate your patience as we rescheduled it to January 8th, at 3pm EST (12 PT). The topic will be using ADO.NET Data Services from Silverlight, one of my favorite topics :) Come for the great topic, conversation and demos!

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Last week I presented several sessions at <a href="http://www.vslive.com">VSLive</a> Dallas along with some great other speakers. I attached the latest session code samples to this blog post since some of the code was written on the fly. It was a cold couple of days in Dallas, a brisk change from southwest Florida! But it really was a blast. We had a great group of speakers and attendees in a smaller atmosphere than some in the past. The result was even more discussions, great conversations and camaraderie. Some of the best discussions came from the <a href="http://www.vslive.com">VSLive</a> speaker panel event where several speakers including Richard, Rocky, Josh, <a href="http://silverlight.net/blogs/jesseliberty/">Jesse</a>, Rich and I all had to answer some interesting and some tough questions about .NET state today and its future. It was all great stuff and I look forward to the next one.</p>

    <p>Now that my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596523092/johnpanet-20">Silverlight 2 book</a> is going to be in stores very soon I’ve taken a look back at some of the books I wrote through the years. Here is a cover shot from an ADO book I coauthored eons ago. And no, the new book has a very normal cover … no more pyramids!</p>
<p>A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away … I wrote a book with 4 of my friends. The book may not be remembered, but the cover certainly has been. 10 years later I still have people come up to me and say “hey, that was you on that crazy cover!”. Ah, geeky humor :)</p>

    <p>My book went to print today, so it will be available for purchase as soon as they finish waxing and polishing it. I plan on having materials to supplement the book including all code samples in C# and VB, a forum for questions and discussions, as well as additional material on <a href="http://www.silverlight-data.com">www.silverlight-data.com</a> . These will be made available over the next few weeks as we get closer to the book being available at stores. The first of these are the forums, which was launched tonight. You can <a href="http://forums.oreilly.com/category/41/Data-Driven-Services-with-Silverlight-2/">check out the forums</a> and post any questions or general discussion right now over at the O’Reilly site. </p>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Earlier today I had the opportunity to present a session at <a href="http://www.tampacodecamp.com/">Tampa Code Camp</a> 2008 on ADO.NET Data Services and Silverlight 2. Oh, and the code camps was a nice place to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596523092/johnpanet-20">promote my new book too</a> :-). The session went well, we had lots of great questions, some good after the session chats, and none of my demos broke :-) … which is always good.&#160; As promised, <a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/downloads/TampaCodeCamp2008-AstoriaAndSilveright.pdf">here are the slides from my presentation.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596523092/johnpanet-20"><img title="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; margin: 5px 5px 5px 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="207" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/ADO.NETDataServicesandSilverlightatTampa_12C81/image_3.png" width="162" align="left" border="0" /></a> </p>
<p>The best part of code camps is the chance to meet up with people you don’t see face to face in the community on a regular basis. I really enjoy talking to everyone .. we have a fantastic .NET community here in Florida! People came from Naples, Jacksonville, Lakeland, Orlando, Tampa, Sarasota, Dunedin, Gainesville, and various other parts of Florida. I believe at one point <a href="http://www.devfish.com">Joe Healy</a> counted 250 attendees showed up (I may be wrong). Joe usually puts photos up for the vents, too, so keep an eye out for them. Overall, I had a great time even though I had about 4 hours of sleep between my company Christmas party (in Orlando) the night before and speaking at Tampa Code Camp the morning. I hope nobody noticed how tired I was :) The whole crew that put this together should feel proud. There were lots of them, so I won;t name them all for fear of missing someone … but it went off quite well.</p>
<p>Oh! I almost forgot …. I am honored to have <a href="http://www.timheuer.com">Tim Heuer</a> write the foreward for my book. We just sent the cover to the printer and the book will go to the printer this coming week. Tim was very kind to write the foreward for it and I am thrilled to have him included! </p>
