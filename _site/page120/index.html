    <a href="/all/2008/02/01/smartphone-skills-part-03-development-environment.html">Smartphone Skills&#58; Part 03 - Development Environment</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>So far in this series I have introduced the basics of Smartphone development and how to get setup with the device emulators. Now that we’re ready to do some Smartphone development (or in general in mobile development)&nbsp;its time to crank up the IDE, familiarize yourself with the tools and start coding. So that’s what we’ll do in this post. </p>
<p>&lt;FONT color=#009f00&gt;*** In case you want to review my previous posts on this topic, I’ll include a list of the posts in this series at the bottom of each post.</p>
<p>&lt;BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style=”MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px”&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;***&lt;/FONT&gt; Before we kick in too far,you might want to grab the latest service pack (which came out a week ago) for the mobile development. You can grab the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0c1b0a88-59e2-4eba-a70e-4cd851c5fcc4&amp;displaylang=en">.NET Compact Framework 2.0 Service Pack 1 from this link here</a>.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt; &lt;P&gt; &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;<strong>Creating a New Project – Hello World!</strong>&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Once you have the tools installed such as the CF, the Smartphone SDK and any emulators (see my previous posts in this series for the links if you need them) the next step is to create your first project. So we start by opening Visual Studio.NET 2005 and creating a new project. You’ll want to choose the language, then choose “Smart Device” and then select “Windows Mobile 5.0 Smartphone” from the project type list. Then select “Device Application” since we’ll be developing a simple interactive “Hello World” application. (If you do not see “Windows Mobile 5.0 Smartphone” in the project type list, you need to install the Smartphone SDK.)&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;IMG alt=”” src=”/photos/jpapa/images/146814/425x309.aspx” border=0&gt; &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;<strong></strong> &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;<strong>The IDE </strong>&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;The first thing you’ll probably notice is that the default form’s designer appears (Form1.cs) and it looks like a Smartphone device. While the designer may not look exactly like the Smartphone you might own, its got the basic Smartphone criteria: the left and right menu buttons (soft keys), the D-pad for navigation and the ability to enter alphanumeric characters. Just like standard WinForm development, these buttons have events that you can write code for. The form itself has a title which you will want to customize (I’ll make mine say “Hello World”) and you can throw controls on the form, too.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;IMG alt=”” src=”/photos/jpapa/images/146817/175x425.aspx” border=0&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt; &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;<strong>The Toolbox</strong>&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;The Toolbox has some familiar controls such as the combo box, label, and textbox. On a Smartphone the button control is not used that often. Rather, the conventional way to select, save, continue or perform other events normally associated with a button control are handled with the soft key menu buttons or by clicking the middle of the D-pad. (A general rule of thumb is to always allow the click of the D-pad to perform a “selection” or a “done” action appropriate for the current screen.) &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt; &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;<strong>Menus</strong>&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;The soft keys are generally associated with menus that you can build in the Smartphone, too. The right menu (or soft key) often opens a menu for the current form. The menu often is used to show options for the current form including properties, settings, options, etc. Menu best practices still hold true here … keep your menu’s to 1 or 2 deep at most. On a Smartphone, even 2 deep menus can get messy. Keep your menu labels short, too. Space is very limited. Common terms are:&lt;/P&gt; &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Options &lt;LI&gt;Tools &lt;LI&gt;Properties &lt;LI&gt;Select &lt;LI&gt;Refresh &lt;LI&gt;Done &lt;LI&gt;Cancel &lt;LI&gt;Exit&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;P&gt; &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;<strong>Other Tips</strong>&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Remember, we’re short of space. So keep the design of your forms small. Avoid the need to scroll  if possible, but it is OK to scroll a little. Generally, I try to keep my screens clean with all controls visible but if i cannot, I make sure there are no more than double the height (meaning don’t add more than a few controls off screen). Another option is to use the soft key menu (usually the right one) to continue to the next page … similar to a (gulp) wizard.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Make sure you include an Exit option in your application. Its a big pet peeve of mine when applications do not include an Exit menu option on a Smartphone. Leaving your application running with no friendly way to kill it is just wrong. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt; &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;<strong>The Hello World Application</strong>&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Well, I promised to keep each of these posts short and sweet. So I’ll save the Hello World application for the next post in this series. I hope this one gave you a quick and dirty run through of creating an application and getting familiar with the IDE.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt; &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt; &lt;TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=1&gt; &lt;TBODY&gt; &lt;TR bgColor=navy&gt; &lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Smartphone Skills Series: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt; &lt;TR&gt; &lt;TD&gt; &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;<a href="/blogs/john.papa/archive/2006/06/04/146047.aspx">Part 01 – Introduction</a> &lt;LI&gt;<a href="/blogs/john.papa/archive/2006/06/06/146142.aspx">Part 02 – Setup and Device Emulators</a> &lt;LI&gt;<a href="/blogs/john.papa/archive/2006/06/25/146818.aspx">Part 03 – Development Environment </a>&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</p>

    <a href="/all/2008/02/01/smartphone-skills-part-02-setup-and-device-emulators.html">Smartphone Skills&#58; Part 02 - Setup and Device Emulators</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>In my last post (<a href="/blogs/john.papa/archive/2006/06/04/146047.aspx">Smartphone Skills: Part 01 - Introduction)</a> I ran through a few of the links that you can use to get started with Smartphone development. In this post&nbsp;I will discuss how to setup the .NET 2 development environment and use the Device Emulator Manager.</p>
<p>Assuming you already have Visual Studio.NET 2005 installed including the compact framework, the next steps are to download and install the rest of the tools you will need. </p>
<p><strong>ActiveSync 4.1 (or latest version)</strong></p>
<p>Download and install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=4c254e3f-79d5-4012-8793-d2d180a42dfa&amp;DisplayLang=en">ActiveSync 4.1</a> if you have not already done so. ActiveSync is required by the Windows Mobile 5 SDK (next step). ActiveSync is used to synchronize the data and generally help you communicate with the mobile device. It also facilitates the installation of software from a PC to the device. </p>
<p><strong>Windows Mobile 5.0 SDK for Smartphone&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Download the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=dc6c00cb-738a-4b97-8910-5cd29ab5f8d9&amp;displaylang=en">Windows Mobile 5.0 SDK for Smartphone</a>&nbsp;and install it. This will give you all that you need to develop for the Smartphone. Make sure you download and install the Smartphone edition as there is also an edition for the Pocket PC available. Again, these are 2 different flavors of the Windows Mobile 5 OS. You can install both SDK’s if you intend to develop for both types of devices. </p>
<p>&lt;IMG src="/photos/jpapa/images/146147/439x480.aspx" border=0&gt;</p>
<p>Once the SDK is installed, you will be able to create projects for the mobile devices. The SDK installs project templates that you can use to do this. The SDK also install the Device Emulator Manager, which gets added to your Tools menu in the Visual Studio.NET IDE. The Device Emulator Manager allows you to choose the destination device type that you want to test your application in. When you install the Smartphone SDK, several emulators are installed and show up in the available emulator list in the Device Emulator Manager including a versions for Smartphone 200 and Windows Mobile 5. When testing your application, you can select which emulator to run the app in. This is a great feature since it allows you to test the applications without installing software on a target device (and uninstalling, installing, repeat process … yuk). It also allows you to develop and test software for multiple target devices.</p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Custom Device Emulators</strong></p>
<p>OK, so you bought a specific device and you want to make sure your application&nbsp;works in that specific device. Some manufacturers provide developers access to tools that help them develop software for their devices. Motorola provides a web site that has several tools and other information to assist developers. Since I recently bought a Motorola Q Smartphone, I went to their <a href="http://developer.motorola.com/">MotoDev</a> web site and found the <a href="http://developer.motorola.com/?path=1.2.5.149">Motorola Q tools</a>. On this page I downloaded the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=eb580a44-cb40-4be1-9ff3-e224bf669cd0&amp;DisplayLang=en">emulator for the 320x240 landscape screen </a>(because the Q has a screen that is different from most Smartphones and PDA’s in that its screen is not square not portrait … it is landscape). This is actually a link to the Microsoft download site. </p>
<p>&lt;IMG src="/photos/jpapa/images/146155/262x480.aspx" border=0&gt;</p>
<p>I then installed the emulator for the landscape screen. I could have stopped there as it would have given me what I needed to test the landscape UI, but I went one step further and downloaded and installed the <a href="http://developer.motorola.com/?path=1.2.6.29.366">Q plug-in for the landscape emulator</a>. This plug-in adds an additional emulator to the Device Emulator Manager that looks just like the Motorola Q (similar to a skin). Of course, these custom emulators are not critical, you can sue the default ones that come with the Windows Mobile 5 SDK. Its just an extra step to make your emulator look and feel more like the target device. Its always a good idea to try your application’s code out in as many emulators as you are targeting devices.</p>
<p>Once you have have ActiveSync, the SDK and the emulators installed … you can start developing. </p>

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I decided to start a series of blog posts regarding various aspects of using, customizing&nbsp;and developing for the Windows Mobile 5 Smartphone. This will be the first post … in which&nbsp;I will begin by describing what to expect and where to get some of the basics. I’ll try to keep this series short and to the point so they are very digestible. (On that same note, there may end up being a lot of posts in this series depending on how many topics I end up covering.)</p>
<p>Let me start by getting this out right away … I will not be discussing any other mobile OS.&nbsp;I will only be focusing on the Windows&nbsp;Mobile 5 for Smartphones (with a light sprinkling of Pocket PC). yeah, the name “Smartphone Skills” is a bit odd … but I thought it was catchy.</p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What is it the Smartphone OS?</strong></p>
<p>Its a bit of a niche … its not just Windows Mobile 5 development, but its development for the Smartphone version of the OS. The Smartphone version of the OS is a bit scaled down than that of the Pocket PC version of the OS. The Windows Mobile 5 for the Smartphone is targeted for (obviously) Smartphones … which generally are phone 1st, PDA 2nd. (There is also a&nbsp;Pocket PC edition and a Pocket PC Phone edition, the latter of which is generally agreed upon as PDA 1st and phone 2nd.) I won’t go into all of the differences nor do I know them all by heart. However, some of the big differences are that the Smartphone OS does not handle stylus/pen events as the screen for Smartphones are not interactive. The user uses special keys on the phone to interact with the applications. Smartphone OS usually does not support some software, as well … usually because the applications require too&nbsp;much stylus interaction with the touch screen. So Office products like Pocket Word and Pocket Excel do not come with the Windows Mobile 5 OS on the Smartphone. (However, Outlook does.) Anyway, a description as per Microsoft can be found on the site <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/about/faq.mspx#2">located here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So What Do You Need?</strong></p>
<p>There are plenty of tools that are helpful, but here is the core list of tools you need to get started in developing for the Smartphone.</p>
<ol> <li>1) Visual Studio.NET (I’ll be using 2005) <li>2) .NET Compact Framework (I’ll be using v 2.0 but you could use version 1.1) <li>3) <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=dc6c00cb-738a-4b97-8910-5cd29ab5f8d9&amp;displaylang=en">Windows Mobile 5.0 SDK for Smartphone</a> (there is another SDK for Pocket PC) <li>4) You do NOT need an actual Smartphone to do any development. You could instead use the device emulator that comes with Visual Studio.NET. <li>5) <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=4c254e3f-79d5-4012-8793-d2d180a42dfa&amp;DisplayLang=en">ActiveSync 4.1</a> … even if you are not going to use an actual Smartphone and you will instead rely on the emulator, you will still want to install the latest version of ActiveSync (currently 4.1). In fact, I believe the SDK will not even install unless ActiveSync is installed first.</li> <p>Once you have these installed you can get started and write you first mobile application.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Other Useful Links (maybe):</strong></p> <p>Here are some links that can help you get started:</p> <ul> <li> <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/smartphone/default.mspx">Windows Mobile 5 Smartphone</a> <li> <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/pocketpc/phone/default.mspx">Windows Mobile 5 Pocket PC Phone Edition</a> <li> <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/about/faq.mspx#2">Difference between Pocket PC and Smartphone</a> <li> <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/developers/default.mspx">Windows Mobile Developer site</a></li> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Next time in Smartphone Skills I will talk a little more about getting setup.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> &lt;TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=1&gt; <tbody> &lt;TR bgColor=navy&gt; <td>&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Smartphone Skills Series: </td> <tr> <td> <ul> <li><a href="/blogs/john.papa/archive/2006/06/04/146047.aspx">Part 01 –&nbsp;Introduction</a> <li><a href="/blogs/john.papa/archive/2006/06/06/146142.aspx">Part 02 – Setup and Device Emulators</a> <li><a href="/blogs/john.papa/archive/2006/06/25/146818.aspx">Part 03 –&nbsp;Development Environment&nbsp;</a></li>

    <a href="/all/2008/02/01/slingbox-encryption.html">Slingbox Encryption</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I bought a Slingbox recently and have been using it just about everywhere I could to test it out. I&rsquo;ll be posting a review on it soon (stay tuned) but something stuck out at me this weekend. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/07/22/slingbox-encryption-upgrade-limits-functionality/">I read that Sling Media has announced that they will now encrypt their transmission of the data from the Slingbox</a>. You can <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/07/22/slingbox-encryption-upgrade-limits-functionality/">read the article here</a> on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget </a>&hellip; but it sounds like they are doing it to help appease the broadcasters, who have never been thrilled with the idea of placeshifting. </p>
<p>If this is correct, one side effect of this is that <a href="http://www.applian.com/">Applian&rsquo;s&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.applian.com/at-large-recorder/index.php">At-Large Recorder</a> (formerly known as Replay SlingCorder), which records media from a SlingBox to a&nbsp;Windows media file (.asf or .wmv) &nbsp;file may no longer function properly due to this encryption. This product is on my list of products to review, but it appears that&nbsp;At-Large Recorder&nbsp;may have hit a major hurdle with Sling Media&rsquo;s encryption. Applian even put a posting on their web site stating the following &hellip;</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"> <p><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="2">Important News (7/13/06): SlingBox&trade; firmware v1.0.86, currently in beta, will not work with At-Large Recorder due to Sling's decision to add encryption to the stream. Make sure to use firmware v1.0.80 instead.</font></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>All of this is according to what I read in news articles and from the <a href="http://www.applian.com/at-large-recorder/index.php">Applian web site</a>, so I do not claim to know the definitive facts on this issue. However, if you are looking at getting the Replay SlingCorder, i highly recommend doing your own research first with <a href="http://www.applian.com/">Applian</a>.</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/all/2008/02/01/scope_identity-and-identity-demystified.html">SCOPE_IDENTITY() and @@IDENTITY Demystified</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>&lt;FONT face=Tahoma&gt;I’ve run across several applications where the use of IDENTITY values has caused some confusion, specifically in how the @@IDENTITY function operates given external influences. We’ve all likely&nbsp;been faced with how to grab the newly generated IDENTITY value from a SQL Server database table. And there are a 2 popular techniques that accomplish this with SQL Server: </p>
<ol> <li>&lt;FONT face=Tahoma&gt;the @@IDENTITY function <li>&lt;FONT face=Tahoma&gt;the SCOPE_IDENTITY() function</li> <p>&lt;FONT face=Tahoma&gt;They both will return a newly generated ID value but the difference between the 2 is very important. Important enough that you could get back an ID that you did not desire. The @@IDENTITY function returns the last IDENTITY value that was generated in your connection. So if you are running a stored procedure that looks something like this (using the Northwind database):</p>&lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt; <p>CREATE&lt;FONT size=2&gt; &lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt;PROCEDURE&lt;FONT size=2&gt; prRegion_Insert_1</p> <p>@description &lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt;NCHAR&lt;FONT color=#808080 size=2&gt;(&lt;FONT size=2&gt;50&lt;FONT color=#808080 size=2&gt;)</p>&lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt; <p>AS</p>&lt;FONT size=2&gt; <p>&lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INSERT&lt;FONT size=2&gt; &lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt;INTO&lt;FONT size=2&gt; Region &lt;FONT color=#808080 size=2&gt;(&lt;FONT size=2&gt;RegionDescription&lt;FONT color=#808080 size=2&gt;)&lt;FONT size=2&gt; &lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt;VALUES&lt;FONT size=2&gt; &lt;FONT color=#808080 size=2&gt;(&lt;FONT size=2&gt;@description&lt;FONT color=#808080 size=2&gt;)</p>&lt;FONT size=2&gt; <p>&lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SELECT&lt;FONT size=2&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff00ff size=2&gt;@@IDENTITY</p>&lt;FONT size=2&gt; <p>GO</p> <p>&lt;FONT face=Tahoma&gt;Assuming that your database has no other actions that occur between the INSERT statement and the SELECT @@IDENTITY statement, then you will get back the newly created RegionID value for the new Region row. But what if there is n Insert Trigger, for example, on the Region table that inserts a record into another table that also has an IDENTITY column. (Perhaps it does this to audit data.) In this case, the sequence of events would be:</p> <ol> <li>&lt;FONT face=Tahoma&gt;the stored proc fires <li>&lt;FONT face=Tahoma&gt;insert the new region record <li>&lt;FONT face=Tahoma&gt;the trigger fires  <li>&lt;FONT face=Tahoma&gt;the trigger’s code inserts the audit record <li>&lt;FONT face=Tahoma&gt;the stored proc then executes the SELECT @@IDENTITY, which then returns the ID that was created by the last statement, which is the audit table’s ID</li> <p>&lt;FONT face=Tahoma&gt;In this case, the ID returned is the ID value that was created by the insert statement inside of the trigger. You might say that you would never put a trigger on a table that inserts into a table with an IDENTITY column in the first place. And I’d believe you … However … other developers and&nbsp;database administrators may create a trigger in the future that does this. They might not know that you wrote a stored procedure (or series of them) &nbsp;that relies on this situation not occurring. The point is that “stuff” happens (polite way of saying it). </p> <p>&lt;FONT face=Tahoma&gt;&nbsp;</p> <p>&lt;FONT face=Tahoma&gt;So what does SCOPE_IDENTITY() do? It returns the last IDENTITY value generated in the scope. So what is the scope? The scope is a batch of SQL code such as s stored procedure, a trigger, or a user defined function. Using the previous example, the scope is the context of the stored procedure and not anything that gets called indirectly by it such as a trigger. This allows you to grab the last generated ID in the stored procedure, as you likely intended for it to happen. Here is another stored procedure that uses the SCOPE_IDENTITY() to grab the last ID generated in the Region table.</p>&lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt; <p>CREATE&lt;FONT size=2&gt; &lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt;PROCEDURE&lt;FONT size=2&gt; prRegion_Insert_2</p> <p>@description &lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt;NCHAR&lt;FONT color=#808080 size=2&gt;(&lt;FONT size=2&gt;50&lt;FONT color=#808080 size=2&gt;)</p>&lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt; <p>AS</p>&lt;FONT size=2&gt; <p>&lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INSERT&lt;FONT size=2&gt; &lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt;INTO&lt;FONT size=2&gt; Region &lt;FONT color=#808080 size=2&gt;(&lt;FONT size=2&gt;RegionDescription&lt;FONT color=#808080 size=2&gt;)&lt;FONT size=2&gt; &lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt;VALUES&lt;FONT size=2&gt; &lt;FONT color=#808080 size=2&gt;(&lt;FONT size=2&gt;@description&lt;FONT color=#808080 size=2&gt;)</p>&lt;FONT size=2&gt; <p>&lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SELECT&lt;FONT size=2&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff00ff size=2&gt;SCOPE_IDENTITY&lt;FONT color=#808080 size=2&gt;()</p>&lt;FONT size=2&gt; <p>GO</p> <p>&lt;FONT face=Tahoma&gt;Is it magic? Nah. But sometimes the smallest things can have huge impacts on our applications.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;&nbsp;</p>
