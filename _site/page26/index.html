  <h2>
    <a href="/p90x/personal/2011/02/16/days-5-amp-6-of-our-p90x-journey.html">Days 5 & 6 of our P90X Journey</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>&ldquo;Dad, you only have 84 days left!&rdquo; says my oldest daughter today on the way to school. That big mountain ahead of me, I still feel good about our first 6 days on P90X. Truth be told, I&rsquo;ll still be exercising after this &hellip; I was exercising about 8 hours a week before, just not to this extent of intensity and well roundedness. But I am not going to think about day 90 yet &hellip; heck, I&rsquo;m not thinking more than a day or 2 ahead right now.</p>
<p>My wife Colleen and I are enjoying the P90X videos. The exercises change every minute or so and Tony Horton is very entertaining. Colleen is doing the lean program and I am doing the classic, so days 3-7 are the same for us. I&rsquo;m really proud of how she is doing with this program and the diet. It really helps to have each other for support.</p>
<p>Day 5 was backs and legs. The weight workout for my back was good, but certainly not as strenuous as the gajillions of pushups on Day 1 (Back and Chest). The legs were a good workout, with the only exercise that really killed me being the wall squats. I could really feel the burn there. Overall, great workout for Day 5 but I was not wiped out by it the way I was for the others. Perhaps the Yoga from the day before had be all limber <img src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/Windows-Live-Writer/Days-5--6-of-our-P90X-Journey_1C4/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png" alt="Smile" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-style: none;" /></p>
<p>We did the Kenpo X video on day 6 as today &hellip; which is a ton of kicks, punches and blocks in the martial arts style. It&rsquo;s a great workout that I felt in both cardio and working the muscles. The workout was not difficult though many of the moves take a lot of coordination that at times can be daunting for beginners like us.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the stretching day and then we work into week 2 of the first 30 days. I&rsquo;m feeling great and I am noticing some small improvements in some areas. Colleen is feeling much better too. More energy for both us and we&rsquo;re enjoying the workouts. We both sighed at the thought of a stretching day tomorrow as we both want to keep at it. But the rest/stretching is part of the program so the body can recover.</p>
<p>One thing we&rsquo;re both considering is getting a heart rate monitor. The gym machines are a joke as I can have a heart rate of 90 or even 168 when I sprint &hellip; um, if I could sprint with a HR of 90 &hellip; well, that;s just wrong. The HR monitors with chest straps seem to still be the most accurate, so I&rsquo;ll likely pick one up that does basic HR. It is handy to make sure we are in the zone &hellip; helps to tell if we need to push it harder or even when we need to rest.</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/p90x/personal/2011/02/13/p90xday4.html">Day 4 of my P90X Journey - Yoga</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Tables, wheels, bridges, downward dog, upward dog, and warrior poses &hellip; huh? You can tell I&rsquo;ve never done yoga before, but thankfully Colleen had so she was able to explain some of it to me as we went. It was 90 minutes long and the first 45 had me sweating like crazy. Massively intense doing positions my body was crying out &ldquo;are you kidding?&rdquo;. But it really felt good. The second 45 minutes was also intense but in a less muscle exerting way and more of a flexibility thing &hellip; except a few spots where we worked abs again.</p>
<p>By the end of the 90 minutes I was able to touch my toes, something I have NEVER been able to do. I&rsquo;ve always been so tight in my legs and I am really looking forward to how this can help me be more flexible. I was able to do almost all of the positions (no wheels for me though) even though in some I could not stretch nearly as far as the pros could. Even when I can&rsquo;t keep up with them I try and push. if I need a mini break, I take it and get right back into it. Assuming like most athletics that &ldquo;keeping at it&rdquo; and &ldquo;giving it your all&rdquo; will prove fruitful.</p>
<p>My body feels great and it was fun to do this one side by side with Colleen. We are on the same workouts for days 3-7, which is handy. Tomorrow is back to muscle groups for legs and back &hellip; actually looking forward to it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re keeping the diet in shape too. Again, mostly lowered the sugar and carb intake for this phase and increased the proteins. 1 day at a time.</p>

    <a href="/p90x/personal/2011/02/13/day-3-of-my-p90x-journey-ndash-arms-shoulders-and-abs.html">Day 3 of my P90X Journey - Arms, Shoulders and Abs</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I feel pretty awesome.</p>
<p>Some of this great feeling has to be from the better eating too. I cut out junk food and cut down my crap snacks to one a day or zero per day. So far the worst thing I eat is a yogurt or a cereal. So not bad. I&rsquo;m eating a lot of proteins now, which is a shift from my usual eating habits of lots of sugar and carbs. I love my carbs &hellip; pasta, steamed white rice, bread &hellip; oh I love those. The first month has you cut back on carbs big time and ramp up on proteins. Of course, overall the sugars are supposed to go down too. It&rsquo;s really not rocket science &hellip; the eating habits I am doing now are really pretty much in line with the caloric intake I had before, just&nbsp; instead of a 200 calorie junk food I eat 200 calories in fruits or a protein shake. I&rsquo;m not looking for weight loss, though it certainly would happen if I wasn&rsquo;t already trim.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s workout was the easiest so far &hellip; arms and shoulders. I bounced around between biceps and triceps and shoulders for the hours through a variety of about 15 exercises &hellip; twice each. Sounds worse than it is. They all went pretty well, still an intense workout and some were much harder than others, but I felt the burn with them all. It was a good feeling though. I did the bonus exercise round, which was another 3 sets (twice again).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then came the ab ripper X (every day 1, 3 and 5) &hellip; I did better this time than on day 1 but it really is intense. It is about 15 minutes of various ab exercises, many of which I felt intensely and had to pause during. I was proud that I was able to do darn close to all the reps but there were points I just laid on the floor in between and was hoping Tony Horton would take a break longer than 10 seconds. He didn&rsquo;t in this routine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s over now and I&rsquo;m feeling good. The recovery drink is nice right after the workout &hellip; especially in our new blender that actually mixes everything. Hard to believe we had a crappy blender for 15 years that never mixed anything well.</p>
<p>Colleen and I are on the same workouts for days 3-7 (she does the lean workout and I do the classic). So she had her first taste of the weights and the ab ripper today. The ab ripper beat her up too but I was so proud that she stuck with it.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is yoga, but tonight is a good night sleep.</p>
<p>Not sure if I will blog every day &hellip; but for now I enjoy writing it down as it motivates me and serves as a journal of how it went for me to look back on.</p>
<p>Some folks asked what kind of shape you have to be in to start. First, I won&rsquo;t try to tell anyone how to exercise &hellip; I&rsquo;m not qualified. But I was in pretty good shape having played soccer a lot and for the past 6 months doing cardio and light weights days a week. It&rsquo;s still intense as heck and working muscles I have not used well in a long time though. Much more rounded. To me, I think as long as a person is doing exercise of any kind, they should be proud. Something is always better than nothing. Doesn&rsquo;t matter what program it is &hellip; my key is to find something that keeps my interest. Goals are important too &hellip; mine are not to be huge. I really have no desire for that at all. My goal is to be more flexible, stronger, faster, and more agile.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll see how this goes.</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/p90x/personal/2011/02/12/day-2-of-p90x.html">Day 2 of P90X</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Day 2 is in the books and it was pretty intense. It was about an hour of Plyometrics, which is a lot of squatting, jumping, moving your feet around, hopping, and doing flips. OK, well no flips, but it felt like it for some of the exercises.&nbsp; Day 1 was all weights and Day 2 is a lot of agility, flexibility, and cardio. It&rsquo;s a good thing I am in pretty good shape cardio wise, because I could easily see myself falling down during this one each week. I won&rsquo;t pretend it was easy for me, because it certainly was not. It was very difficult.</p>
<p>This morning (day 3) I&rsquo;m certainly feeling it in my quads and hamstrings. Totally expected of course. My lower back is sore from both days of workouts. It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ll work through, but it certainly does not help. It&rsquo;s the second recurring pain I have from my motorcycle accident 19+ years ago. But really, overall I feel as can be expected after 2 days of intense workouts.</p>
<p>Today is Day 3 where I&rsquo;ll be working out on my shoulders and arms program &hellip; and again the ab ripper program. I hope my muscles have recovered enough from Day 1. We shall see. The pushups from Day 1 alone were murder. I did 125 pushups on Day 1 .. sounds like a lot but I think the &ldquo;pros&rdquo; in the video did 350+ of them. I&rsquo;m still having nightmares of the div bomber push ups.</p>
<p>We cleaned out the pantry pretty well today and bought a ton of fruits and vegetables Which is fine since we like a lot of those (mostly fruits). We also bought Colleen a new blender (our old one was 16 years old and barely moved anymore) so now we are making smoothies and protein shakes. Sounds awful but really, for a picky guy like me I still love several variations of them. I tossed some strawberries, oranges and bananas into a chocolate protein shake drink for breakfast and it was amazingly good.</p>
<p>Of course we&rsquo;re eating pretty close to the plans they give. The first month it&rsquo;s a fat burning phase which is pretty high on protein and low on carbs. After that, the protein stays high but carbs go back up. It&rsquo;s a little hard because some of my favorite foods are pasta, white rice and bread. sigh. I still have some carbs each day so its not too bad. I need more protein in my diet anyway.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the support &hellip; I&rsquo;ll keep blogging and see where this leads.</p>

    <a href="/p90x/personal/2011/02/10/day-1-of-p90x.html">Day 1 of P90X</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I&rsquo;ve been running, playing soccer, and keeping in pretty good shape but I want to see some better results. I&rsquo;ve plateaued in my workouts. So after a lot of research and asking friends who tried it, I decided to try the P90X program. I&rsquo;m going to blog this mostly for myself as a record of how I am doing and to motivate myself.</p>
<p>Prior to Day 1 they ask you to take a fitness test. I did OK, but I gotta tell you that doing those squats against the wall made my legs (quads mostly) feel like jello after 5 minutes. I was able to do it all, which was not surprising other than the pushups. I&rsquo;ve been bad at those ever since I had a horrible motorcycle accident years ago and almost lost my left arm. But I did manage to get through those, so I was encouraged. But man, did I sleep well last night.</p>
<p>So tonight after work I tried Day 1 of the P90X program. Chest, back, some arms, and the abs (Ab Ripper X). I have a workout mat, some push up grips, and some resistance bands I use (with a door loop) which is great since I don&rsquo;t have a place to put a pull up bar (nor do I want one in my house). It was pretty in expensive for those things and they are very useful in the workout.</p>
<p>So Day 1 goes through 12 exercises for chest and back &hellip; twice &hellip; all over an hour period (with warmup and cool down). The first run through was hard. The second run through was even rougher, but I felt good about it. Some of the pushups, like the decline (feet up on a chair) and the dive bomber (not even sure how to explain that one) were so rough that I barely could do the second set of reps for those at all. Needless to say that I did not keep up with the people in the video on more than a small few of the exercise. For many of them I was almost laughable. So much for thinking I am in shape.</p>
<p>Then I went into the ab ripper X program, which is about 15 minutes long and just murders you with various ab exercises. I did them all but man it tore me up. Again, rep count was lower than they like you to do, but I did my best.</p>
<p>So after a day&nbsp; of this I feel good about it so far. What I like is that it changes up every minute or so so I don&rsquo;t get bored. I like the program so I don;&rsquo;t have to think about what I am going to do next. At the gym, I get into routines and that&rsquo;s why I flattened out with my workouts. I really like that he talks you through it all and that I don&rsquo;t have to worry about doing the insane number of reps they do every time. Do what you can, work it hard, keep good form.</p>
<p>The food is a bit of a confusion point so far, I&rsquo;m still working that out. But I eat pretty well &hellip; just need to try to match the proper nutrition intakes they suggest because it is different depending on what phase you are in. I absolutely love the Pure Protein bars (chocolate fudge is my favorite). I ate one for a snack today before my workout and it made my hunger go away for hours and carried me through the workout (that and a lot of water).</p>
<p>Next up, plyometrics tomorrow. Wish me luck &hellip; I know I&rsquo;ll sleep well tonight. I&rsquo;m just hoping I can stick with it for the 90 days &hellip; I&rsquo;ll take some time off and do something light when I travel for a week in April in hotels, but for now, its all about getting through each day&rsquo;s workout.</p>

    <a href="/silverlight/2011/01/31/my-top-10-mix11-open-call-votes.html">My Top 10 MIX11 Open Call Votes</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Just like last year, the MIX11 event team has published an open call for sessions. The great part about this open call is that its all voted on by you! There are so many great sessions to choose form and on a variety of topics which makes it easy to find many you want to vote on. </p>
<p><a href="http://live.visitmix.com/OpenCall"><img alt="Cast Your Vote" src="http://ecn.channel9.msdn.com/mix/11/i/default_center_castvote.gif" /></a></p>
<p>Key points here:</p>
<p>- You only get a say if you vote! So <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/OpenCall">go vote!</a></p>
<p>- Voting ends on Feb 4th, so <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/OpenCall">go vote</a>!</p>
<p>- You get 10 votes, so <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/OpenCall">go vote!</a>&#160;</p>
<p>What did I choose? Well, I like to vote for some sessions about topics that I might not see all that often … or from folks I’d love to see present a session. In short, I like something that interests me (hey it’s my vote!) and usually that means something unique.</p>
<p>Of course, vote for whatever sessions you most want to see. Even if you are not going to MIX11 (and why the heck aren’t you?!) you get to see the sessions on line afterwards.</p>
<p>So without further delay, here are the 10 sessions I voted for in no particular order:</p>
<p>Vote #1: <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/OpenCall/Vote/Session/169">Using Metro Motion Design To Improve App Performance – Matthias Shapiro</a></p>
<blockquote>   <p>I’ve never heard Mathias present before, but this session intrigues me. Motion Design is a great concept for folks to learn about and help with solid UX with Silverlight and Windows Phone. Plus, you won’t see this topic all that often … so he certainly hit the unique topic category. He peaked my interest … my vote’s in the ballet box on this one.</p> </blockquote>
<p>Vote #2: <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/OpenCall/Vote/Session/21">Deep Dive MVVM – Laurent Bugnion</a></p>
<blockquote>   <p>I love architecture, I love data, and I live UX. So put all 3 together and you know I love MVVM. There are a ton of MVVM sessions in the open call, but this is the one I want to see. Laurent understands MVVM and he also knows what is NOT needed too (which is just as important). In his abstract, Laurent (who is a solid presenter) promises this is a deep dive beyond the basics. My vote is cast.</p> </blockquote>
<p>Vote #3: <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/OpenCall/Vote/Session/14">All Thumbs: Redesigning an existing UI to suit Windows Phone 7 – Ward Bell</a></p>
<blockquote>   <p>My favorite quote form the abstract: “the phone is not a tiny desktop”. This session makes a great point about the journey of many Silverlight developers moving to Windows Phone 7. While the skillset is very similar there are some differences that are really important to grasp. I love that this session claims to address those issues.&#160; Plus, the speaker has a history of wearing loud outfits at MIX … such as his white fur “Elvis-ish”jacket last year. Ward had my vote at “All Thumbs”. </p> </blockquote>
<p>Vote #4: <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/OpenCall/Vote/Session/29" target="_blank">Advanced WCF RIA Services – Gill Cleeren</a></p>
<blockquote>   <p>Silverlight is a strong player in business applications and RIA Services is very important in this space. But what attracted me to this session is that Gill states that he’ll cover the “how” of many important aspects of RIA Services including validation and patterns, all while staying at a 300 level. I’m intrigued Mr Cleeren … you got my vote.</p> </blockquote>
<p>Vote #5: <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/OpenCall/Vote/Session/158" target="_blank">Designing for WP7: Metro and Beyond – Guido Rosso</a></p>
<blockquote>   <p>I love good design sessions and the folks at Archetype do some amazing design work. Good design skills are increasingly important in today’s technology. This abstract promises to get into designing solid WP7 apps using the Metro guidelines. I’m very interested in seeing what advice Guido lays on the audience in this session. No second thoughts on this vote.</p> </blockquote>
<p>Vote #6: <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/OpenCall/Vote/Session/161" target="_blank">Microsoft Surface v2 – designing for the new form factor – Josh Santangelo</a></p>
<blockquote>   <p>Surface v2 is awesome and this session was the one that stood out most to me. I want one in my house … voted.</p> </blockquote>
<p>Vote #7: <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/OpenCall/Vote/Session/36" target="_blank">Jumpstart HTML 5 – Mathew David</a></p>
<blockquote>   <p>There is a lot of confusion on what HTML 5 is and is not. This session sounds like its aim is to clarify what HTML 5, CSS3, WVG, jQuery and other aspects are and how they play a role in HTML 5. It seems to be beginner level, but I think it’s a great idea to get folks up to speed so we can have good conversations about it. The man with 2 first names has my vote.</p> </blockquote>
<p>Vote #8: <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/OpenCall/Vote/Session/206" target="_blank">Facebook Development in .NET – Jim Zimmerman</a></p>
<blockquote>   <p>If you have not heard, this thing called Facebook is pretty huge. Jim has done a ton of work integrating with Facebook from .NET and this looks like a great knowledge sharing session. Is there intelligent life here Jim? My vote says yes. </p>    <p>Note: I almost picked the session <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/OpenCall/Vote/Session/88" target="_blank">by Jay Kimble (Facebook and Wp7)</a> on a similar topic. Jay and Jim are both top shelf. Honestly, I could have gone either way, but Jim’s nudged my vote. </p> </blockquote>
<p>Vote #9: <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/OpenCall/Vote/Session/31" target="_blank">Expression Blend and the Visual State Manager: A Deep Dive – Joel Cochran</a></p>
<blockquote>   <p>The VSM gets very little love and it’s a real shame. Lots to learn on this topic and I love having an entire session on it, templating, effects, transitions, and the like. I don’t know Joel but he grabbed my vote.</p> </blockquote>
<p>Vote #10: <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/OpenCall/Vote/Session/33" target="_blank">WCF Data Services, OData &amp; jQuery. If you are an ASP.NET Developer You Should Be Embracing These Technologies – James Coenen-Eyre</a></p>
<blockquote>   <p>Super long title, I’m tired after reading that! I was hoping there would be a great OData and jQuery session in the open call and this one hits the mark from what I can tell by the abstract. These are important topics to know … my votes are locked and loaded.</p> </blockquote>
<p>There are several other sessions that interest me … give me 50 votes and I could certainly fill them out. Give me 10, and this was much harder than I thought.</p>
<p>Like my votes? Cool. Don’t like them? That’s cool too. Go vote …. you’ve got until Feb 4th.</p>
<p>I hope to see you there at MIX 11 … and don’t forget to <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/Sessions">register for my Silverlight Bootcamp!</a></p>
