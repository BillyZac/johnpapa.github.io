  <h2>
    <a href="/silverlight/2009/09/17/tell-the-debugger-to-ignore-silverlight-validation-exceptions.html">Tell the Debugger to Ignore Silverlight Validation Exceptions</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I recently wrote an article that demonstrates how to use the DataForm and validate data entry in Silverlight using the DataAnnotations. One of the pet peeves I have with the validation is that it throws in exception in the setter of your public property. Putting my disagreements with that aside for a second, it causes a major inconvenience when debugging the application. For example, when running the application that uses the DataAnnotations and one of the conditions is violated, the debugger will catch the validation exception and break into the code. The desired behavior is that the debugger will not break into the code since I really just want to see the validation information on screen. </p>
<p>For example, the default behavior when not entering a value for the FirstName property will yield the result shown in the image below.</p>
<p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/TelltheDebuggertoIgnoreSilverlightValida_856D/image_3.png" width="556" height="368" /> </p>
<p>Yes, I can simply hit F5 and it will bypass the exception. But this gets ugly when you have more than one violation and you are testing the app. What I really want is to simply see the validation on screen, as shown below:</p>
<p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/TelltheDebuggertoIgnoreSilverlightValida_856D/image_8.png" width="558" height="87" /> </p>
<p>last night I was chatting with <a href="http://www.jeffhandley.com">Jeff Handley</a> (of DataAnnotations fame) and he mentioned a technique I was unaware of that will ignore the exception of this particular type. I was thrilled to see that it works and is quite simple to do. There is a feature in Visual Studio that allows you to do this (I love learning something new about Visual Studio). Here are the steps you need to go through to ignore the exception in Visual Studio:</p>
<p>1) Go to the Debug menu in Visual Studio, and select the Exceptions menu item</p>
<p>(If the images are hard to read, click on the images below for larger versions of them)</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/TelltheDebuggertoIgnoreSilverlightValida_856D/image_7.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/TelltheDebuggertoIgnoreSilverlightValida_856D/image_thumb_2.png" width="218" height="334" /></a> </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>2) Expand the Common Language Runtime Exceptions item in the list</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/TelltheDebuggertoIgnoreSilverlightValida_856D/image_10.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/TelltheDebuggertoIgnoreSilverlightValida_856D/image_thumb_3.png" width="440" height="232" /></a> </p>
<p>3) Click the Add button to add a new exception type</p>
<p>4) Select Common Language Runtime Exceptions from the drop down list</p>
<p>5) Enter <strong><em>System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.ValidationException</em></strong> in the Name textbox</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/TelltheDebuggertoIgnoreSilverlightValida_856D/image_12.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/TelltheDebuggertoIgnoreSilverlightValida_856D/image_thumb_4.png" width="448" height="139" /></a> </p>
<p>6) Click OK</p>
<p>7) Uncheck the User-unhandled checkbox for the item</p>
<p> System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.ValidationException (the highlighting is mine)</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/TelltheDebuggertoIgnoreSilverlightValida_856D/image_14.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/TelltheDebuggertoIgnoreSilverlightValida_856D/image_thumb_5.png" width="467" height="245" /></a> </p>
<p>8) Click OK</p>
<p>Now when you run your application using the debugger, the debugger will not stop no the exception. It instead will bypass those exceptions and simply display the validation information in your application. Basically skipping right to this:</p>
<p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/TelltheDebuggertoIgnoreSilverlightValida_856D/image_8.png" width="558" height="87" /></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks to Jeff Handley for pointing this out to me!</p>

    <a href="/silverlight/2009/09/10/silverlight-featured-in-sunday-night-football-extra.html">Silverlight Featured in Sunday Night Football Extra</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Tonight is opening night for the NFL season! This year NBC will showing the Sunday Night Football games in HD via Silverlight. You can catch the games at <a href="http://snfextra.nbcsports.com/">http://snfextra.nbcsports.com/</a></p>
<p>It’s just a few minutes into the opening night game and I am watching it side by side with my HD TV to get a comparison. The HD broadcast in Silverlight is quote impressive! But the features built into the Silverlight app are even more impressive. There is a chat window for fans, stats, videos, and game information on the right hand side of the video. There is also a button at the bottom named “Key Plays”. When clicked it displays an area that is reserved for recapping key plays in the game. The video, of course, has DVR features too. I am not taking a screenshot for fear of copyright protection … but if you are interested in it, go ahead and check it out. </p>
<p>It really is quite cool! </p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/silverlight/2009/09/08/5-minute-overview-of-mvvm-in-silverlight.html">5 Minute Overview of MVVM in Silverlight</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Model-View-ViewModel (better known by its super hero alias of MVVM ) is a great pattern to use with Silverlight and WPF. Here is my 5 minute perspective on MVVM (yep, it took me 5 minutes to spit this out too, so please be kind on any typos :-) )</p>
<p>One of the things that can be frustrating with any pattern is the immediate assumption that many articles have that everyone knows what MVVM means. This post is intended to be a <strong>short, quick, and hopefully easy explanation of MVVM</strong>. Another interesting aspect of MVVM is that you can find many ways of actually using MVVM. I will point out some of the differing opinions as I move along. Not all of them, but a few just to give you an idea of what you might see out there. This post assumes the technology is Silverlight or WPF.</p>
<p>This explanation is intended to give an overview on the roles of View, Model and ViewModel. The graphic at the bottom shows the basic association between the MVVM triad. There are different ways to handle some aspects of MVVM. But the element between them all is the singular purpose behind the View, the Model, and the ViewModel.</p>
<p>In a future post I will explain in more detail how I implement MVVM, why I chose the way I do it, and some of the pros and cons.</p>
<p><strong><font size="4">Why?</font></strong></p>
<p>1 reason MVVM works really well with XAML based applications is because of the powerful XAML binding features. This allows the View (the presentation of to the user) to be separated from the data and the logic. The View can be designed in Expression Blend while the ViewModel can be developed in Visual Studio .NET. It allows for the presentation to be separated very easily. This is just 1 reason, albeit a powerful one.</p>
<p><strong><font size="4">View</font></strong></p>
<p>A View is a class that represents the user interface that the user will see. In Silverlight this is the MainPage.xaml or Page.xaml class, for example. The View contains the visual controls that will be shown to the user and can also contain animations, navigation aspects, themes, and other interactive features for the purpose of the visual presentation. In Silverlight and WPF the View also contains binding extensions that identify the data points that will be presented to the user (embedded in XAML). The bindings point to the names of the data point properties, but do not have awareness of where those properties are nor where they come from. The bindings are activated when the View’s DataContext is set to a class that contains the source for the bindings.</p>
<blockquote>   <p>Differing Opinions:</p>    <p>Some people create a View and assign it a source for its data right in the View. This can be done by creating a resource in the XAML that points to a ViewModel. I prefer to associate my View and ViewModel separate from each other so they are not coupled. however it is very common to see the ViewModel created inside the View as a resource. Either way is good. Creating it inside the View is easier and can allow for more fun when using Blend. Associating the ViewModel and the View through another class is looser and can allow for more DI and testability. Again, both are good and prominent in the wild.</p> </blockquote>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong><font size="4">Model</font></strong></p>
<p>A class that represents data points describing a specific entity.&#160; For example, a Customer class with properties such as CompanyName and CustomerId. The Model can contains child Model’s too, like any object graph. So a Customer Model can contain a property named Orders which is a set of Order Models. The Model’s purpose is to represent the data points and it has no knowledge of where it will be presented to a user nor how it will be presented. It’s single responsibility is to represent the data points.</p>
<blockquote>   <p>Differring opinions:</p>    <p>Some people create the Model and give it awareness of where it comes from. <strong>I</strong> <strong>do not </strong>take this approach as I like to keep the Model ignorant of this and loosely coupled from where it comes form. However to offer up one different way to handle this it could help to discuss this at a high level. Some make the Model also have awareness of how to load and save itself (persistence awareness). For example, this could mean it knows how to call a web service to do this. Again, I do not do this. Rather I prefer to make that saving and loading of a Model happen in another class which has the single responsibility of handling these aspects. </p> </blockquote>
<p><strong><font size="4">ViewModel</font></strong></p>
<p>The ViewModel is the glue between the View and the outside world. The ViewModel is what the View is bound to. The View’s DataContext is set to an instance of a ViewModel class. This is where all of the bindings declared in the View’s XAML The ViewModel contains the Model, so it has all of the data points needed in many cases right there. The ViewModel also can declare public properties for Commands (ways to invoke actions from the View to the ViewModel) and other properties that can be bound to the View. </p>
<blockquote>   <p>Differing Opinions:</p>    <p>In my architecture, my ViewModel classes make calls to another class that handles filling the Model(s) contained within the ViewModel. Some other ways of doing this are to simply have the ViewModel go get the data himself. Again, I lean towards keeping my classes focused on a single responsibility so my examples generally do not do that. Instead, I have a class that is in charge of hitting a web service to go and get my data and fill my Model for my ViewModel.</p> </blockquote>

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Anyone who knows me well knows that I can’t help but get myself into more activities than I probably have time for. Lately I’ve been working hard to fill a need that I feel exists in the Silverlight community. The goal of this effort it to self enable the community and to connect people with some of the very best code samples and tips out there. I am working with some of the <strong>best</strong> Silverlight minds out there (both in and outside of Microsoft) to get this site together and add content to it. I am not ready to give details yet, but this effort is heavily weighted towards connecting people as opposed to me sharing my thoughts. Let’s face it, the community has a lot to offer.</p>
<p>For example, did you know that there are over 30 great behaviors already out there and written by some incredible minds available for you to use? How about storyboards, pixel shaders, MVVM frameworks? Yup, there are several choices for these too. Need to solve some problems with loading controls, dealing with daily issues? Lot’s of great stuff here as well. </p>
<p>I will be putting a few twitter polls together to gather insight on what you want so we can shape the site towards those ends. The first of these polls is up now and will last for 2 days. Please chime in with your vote:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.twitterpoll.net/node/108">What kinds of samples would you most like to see in a community Silverlight code sharing site?</a></strong></p>

    <a href="/silverlight/2009/08/15/silverlight-2-animation-ndash-book-review.html">Silverlight 2 Animation – Book Review</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>A bit late to the party here, but I finally got around to re-reading <a href="http://designwithsilverlight.com/">Jeff Paries</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Foundation-Silverlight-Animation-Jeff-Paries/dp/1430215690/johnpanet-20">Silverlight 2 Animation book</a>. I met Jeff at <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/">MIX 09</a> and talked to him at the <a href="/silverlight/1st-annual-silverlight-mixer/">Silverlight MIXer party</a>. I also attended his presentation at MIX on animation … the guy is very very good. I had a copy of his book on my desk or review along with about 20 others. I read his book back in April over a weekend. It is very well written with a lot of great examples that take you step by step through animations.&#160; In short, I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to get into Silverlight animations.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Foundation-Silverlight-Animation-Jeff-Paries/dp/1430215690/johnpanet-20"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 5px 5px 5px 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Foundation Silverlight 2 Animation" align="left" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51mNXzfM6HL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-arrow-click,TopRight,35,-76_AA240_SH20_OU01_.jpg" width="240" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>The book covers animations from the perspective of using Silverlight 2 and Blend 2.1. All of the code is applicable to Silverlight 3, however there are some areas that have been improved tremendously in Silverlight 3 such as easing and perspective 3D. In Silverlight 2 the ways to implement some animations took a little more effort, and Jeff walks right through those areas. Obviously Jeff wrote the book for Silverlight 2, so it is not a problem and all of the content is still very relevant. I saw a post from Jeff recently saying he is updating the book for Silverlight 3, too. I hope so because I will be getting it :) </p>
<p>If you are interested in animations in Silverlight, this is an excellent choice. Even if you are just the occasional animator doing things like rotating panels, transitioning views between states, creating interactive buttons … this book will get you there.</p>
<p>2 thumbs up!</p>
<p>UPDATE: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/143022407X/johnpanet-20">Here is a link to the v3 version of the book you can pre-order</a></p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/silverlight/2009/08/14/adding-a-rotating-button-to-the-swivel-behavior-demo.html">Adding a Rotating Button to the Swivel Behavior Demo</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Last week <a href="/silverlight/swivel-behavior-in-silverlight-3/">I posted the code for a swivel behavior I created</a>. It rotates a set of panels 180 degrees. The next step in the rotation process is to add a button that causes the rotation from front to back and then from back to front. This post will talk about how to create a button that does this rotation.</p>
<p>Here is the final result …</p>
<p><br />  &lt;div id="silverlightControlHost_0001"&gt;<object data="data:application/x-silverlight," type="application/x-silverlight-2" width="520" height="320"> 			<param name="source" value="/demos/SwivelBehaviorWithToggleButton/ClientBin/SwivelPanelDemo.xap" /> 			<param name="onerror" value="onSilverlightError" /> 			<param name="background" value="white" /> 			<param name="minRuntimeVersion" value="3.0.40624.0" /> 			<param name="autoUpgrade" value="true" /> 			<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=149156&amp;v=3.0.40624.0" style="text-decoration: none;">      			<img src="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=108181" alt="Get Microsoft Silverlight" style="border-style: none" /> 			</a> 		</object>&lt;iframe style="border-right-width: 0px; width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; height: 0px; visibility: hidden; border-left-width: 0px" id="_sl_historyFrame"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  <br />  &lt;p&gt;First, I created a copy of my panel demo page from <a href="/silverlight/swivel-behavior-in-silverlight-3/">my previous post</a>. I removed my Swivel behavior that I used in the previous post since it kicks off when the grid is clicked. I will replace it shortly.<a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/b432a5e60129_13C32/image_4.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" align="right" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/b432a5e60129_13C32/image_thumb_1.png" width="221" height="260" /></a> Then I dragged a ToggleButton onto the designer from the Assets window in Blend. I want a ToggleButton here because I want the button to perform a alternate animations when the button is clicked. So I intend to use the checked and unchecked state of the ToggleButton to invoke the different states. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Once I added the ToggleButton I decided I wanted to change its look. I created a style for the ToggleButton bu right clicking it in the designer, choosing “Make a Control”, selecting ToggleButton as the type, and adding it to the app.xaml. This created a resource style so I can completely change the look and feel of the ToggleButton. The image on the right shows this process.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The designer then switches over to let you view the resource you just created. I then removed the ToggleButton form the ControlTemplate since I do not want the basic gray rectangular button. The screenshot below shows me deleting the ToggleButton from the ControlTemplate.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;<a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/b432a5e60129_13C32/image10.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 5px 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/b432a5e60129_13C32/image10_thumb.png" width="506" height="318" /></a> &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I replac<a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/b432a5e60129_13C32/image_8.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" align="right" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/b432a5e60129_13C32/image_thumb_3.png" width="83" height="83" /></a>ed the ToggleButton that I removed with a Border. I made the Border have a large corner radius so it looks like a circle, and I filled it with black. Then I added a Grid inside the Border, and put a Path inside the Grid.  The Path looks like an arrowhead (I’ll demonstrate how to make the Path in a future post using some techniques <a href="http://www.85turns.com/">Corey Schuman</a> shared with me). So far my new style for the ToggleButton looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The button needs to show the user that it is ready for action. So while the button is in its “Normal” state I set its Opacity to 40%. When a user hovers (MouseOver) over the button I want the button to change its Opacity to 100%. This screams for the Visual State Manager to lend a hand. So first I selected the outermost Grid panel of my RotateToggleButtonStyle in the Objects and Timeline. Then I click on the States panel and selected the “Normal” state. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;<a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/b432a5e60129_13C32/image23.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 5px 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/b432a5e60129_13C32/image23_thumb.png" width="535" height="164" /></a> &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also shown in the image above is that I set the default transition for the Normal state to .25 seconds and set the easing to use an Exponential EaseInOut. This gives the effect a slightly softer transition. Now that Blend is in recording mode, I set the Opacity in the properties window to 40%. Then I click on the MouseOver state and chaneg the Opacity to 100%. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I also want this button to rotate –540 degrees when checked so it spins counterclockwise 1.5 times. The ToggleButton also has visual states specific to the ToggleButton such as Indeterminate, Unchecked and Checked. This helps me get the rotation animation, which I want to occur over a period of 0.8 second. First I set the default transition for the CheckStates to 0.8 seconds and set the easing to an exponential EaseInOut. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;<a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/b432a5e60129_13C32/image27.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 5px 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/b432a5e60129_13C32/image27_thumb.png" width="524" height="100" /></a> &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then I click the Unchecked state and set the Rotation Transform to 0 degrees. Then I click the Checked state and set the Rotate Transform to –540 degrees (see below).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;<a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/b432a5e60129_13C32/image31.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 5px 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/b432a5e60129_13C32/image31_thumb.png" width="520" height="228" /></a> &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now my RotateToggleButtonStyle is done including its rotational animations, so I close the designer for the resource and I go back to my user control. My ToggleButton has now changed in appearance since it uses the resource I created. The last step is to add my Swivel behavior to the ToggleButton by dragging it in Blend. Then I set the properties of the Swivel behavior to to be invoked on Click of the ToggleButton, use a duration of 0.8 second to match the button rotation, rotate left to right, and use the 2 panels I created (see below).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;<a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/b432a5e60129_13C32/image35.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 5px 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/b432a5e60129_13C32/image35_thumb.png" width="456" height="498" /></a> &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So now that I am all done, you can see the demo at the top of this post. Just click the toggle button and watch it go. Click it again, and watch it flip the panel back and rotate the button to its original state.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You can <a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/downloads/SwivelPane lDemoWithToggleButton.zip">download the code for this sample here</a>.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;<a href="/wp-content/uploads/demos/SwivelBehaviorWithToggleButton/default.html">Or view the demo here</a> outside this post.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Next time I’ll demonstrate how to make the Swivel behavior use 2 buttons: 1 to flip front to back and  to flip back to front. I have had some requests for this for the cases when you want to put the buttons on the panels that swivel and make the buttons look different.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
