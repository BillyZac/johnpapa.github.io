  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I just activated my Nokia Lumia 900 running the latest Windows Phone OS. I purchased the cyan colored Lumia … or blue to me <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/Nokia-Lumia-900-Unboxing_10BF4/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png" /> I’ll post a thorough review later after I get more hands on time with it, but this post is all about first impressions. In short … WOW!</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/Nokia-Lumia-900-Unboxing_10BF4/a_2.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="a" border="0" alt="a" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/Nokia-Lumia-900-Unboxing_10BF4/a_thumb.jpg" width="463" height="788" /></a></p>
<p><em>Tip: Click on the photos for the full size versions. </em></p>
<p>If you want to see <a href="/activating-the-nokia-lumia-900-windows-phone">my activation process experience, you can check it out here</a>.</p>
<p>It arrived on time, as promised from ATT Wireless, via FedEx. Here is the phone inside the box and then a closeup of the box itself (with my number blocked out).</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/Nokia-Lumia-900-Unboxing_10BF4/DSC_2040.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="DSC_2040" border="0" alt="DSC_2040" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/Nokia-Lumia-900-Unboxing_10BF4/DSC_2040_thumb.jpg" width="244" height="165" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/Nokia-Lumia-900-Unboxing_10BF4/image_2.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/Nokia-Lumia-900-Unboxing_10BF4/image_thumb.png" width="244" height="165" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I opened the Lumia box, I found a subtle reminder not to text and drive. How’d they know?</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/Nokia-Lumia-900-Unboxing_10BF4/DSC_2042.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="DSC_2042" border="0" alt="DSC_2042" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/Nokia-Lumia-900-Unboxing_10BF4/DSC_2042_thumb.jpg" width="244" height="165" /></a></p>
<p>Here are the contents of the box laid out on the table. Notice that they sent a funky looking plug and USB cable, that looks oddly familiar. <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile" alt="Winking smile" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/Nokia-Lumia-900-Unboxing_10BF4/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile_2.png" /> There is also a SIM card door key, that is needed to open the door for the sim card. My device came with a sim card already punched out and installed, which was nice. I was upgrading a Samsung Focus (first edition) to the Lumia on the same phone number. But the sim card is a different size, so they sent a new one and installed it for me. </p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/Nokia-Lumia-900-Unboxing_10BF4/DSC_2043.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="DSC_2043" border="0" alt="DSC_2043" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/Nokia-Lumia-900-Unboxing_10BF4/DSC_2043_thumb.jpg" width="210" height="328" /></a></p>
<p>Here is the Lumia 900 cyan from the powered off state all the way through setup&nbsp; and then its initial powered on state. Took about 8 seconds for the first boot to setup, then just a short bit to entered the setup information.</p>

<pre><code> &lt;p&gt;I had to skip the Windows Live setup because I could not get activated right away. Once I was activated, all was well though. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I set up WiFi first and hooked up gmail, twitter (using Rowi from the marketplace), Facebook, and Windows Live. Took about 1 minute to get these going … so I was very happy with that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The screen is awesome. Its bigger than the Samsung Focus and the colors just pop. You can see here the Lumia 900 is larger than the Samsung Focus, but only by a little bit. It appears (and feels) slightly thinner than the Focus too. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/Nokia-Lumia-900-Unboxing_10BF4/DSC_2053.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="DSC_2053" border="0" alt="DSC_2053" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/Nokia-Lumia-900-Unboxing_10BF4/DSC_2053_thumb.jpg" width="244" height="165"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/wp-content/u ploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/Nokia-Lumia-900-Unboxing_10BF4/DSC_2054.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="DSC_2054" border="0" alt="DSC_2054" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/Nokia-Lumia-900-Unboxing_10BF4/DSC_2054_thumb.jpg" width="244" height="165"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/Nokia-Lumia-900-Unboxing_10BF4/DSC_2055.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="DSC_2055" border="0" alt="DSC_2055" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/Nokia-Lumia-900-Unboxing_10BF4/DSC_2055_thumb.jpg" width="244" height="165"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/Nokia-Lumia-900-Unboxing_10BF4/DSC_2056.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="DSC_2056" border="0" alt="DSC_2056" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/Nokia-Lumia-900-Unboxing_10BF4/DSC_2056_thumb.jpg" width="244" height="165"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It looks great, feels great in my hand (heavier than the Focus, but less toy like), and so far is very fast. I’ll reserve judgment on the final review for when I have time to do more hands on with it. But out of the gate, I was very impressed with the device!&lt;/p&gt;

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I received my Nokia Lumia 900 today and was very excited to open it. I had 3 goals for today:</p>
<p>1) activate it</p>
<p>2) make sure my unlimited data plan was still in place</p>
<p>3) get my apps to the new phone</p>
<p>I accomplished 1 and 2 and I am currently working on 3. I’ll be doing an <a href="http://jpapa.me/lumia900unbox">unboxing post shortly after this here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: this review is purely about the ordering, activation and setup process. So this is entirely on ATT … I’ll be reviewing the phone and the OS in a later hands on post.</em></p>
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="DSC_2041" border="0" alt="DSC_2041" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/Nokia-Lumia-900-Unboxing_107C9/DSC_2041_thumb.jpg" width="210" height="328" /></p>
<p><strong>Don’t forget the Micro SIM</strong></p>
<p>Make sure you have a micro sim card before activating. If you went from a Samsung focus, like I did, then this will be key.</p>
<p><strong>Activation</strong></p>
<p>This took me about 30 minutes. I tried in vain for 15 minutes online to activate the phone. Eventually, I called Premier Support at 1-866-499-8008 and they had me turn both phones off, call me back on my wife’s cell phone, and then they activated the Lumia 900. In all, it was 30 minutes form when I opened the box and not a great experience, but it certainly could have been much worse. That it did not work online and that the guy kept putting me on hold without explaining anything was not good. But 30 minutes is not terrible. So I give this activation process a generous&nbsp; 7/10.</p>
<p><strong>Data Plan</strong></p>
<p>I formerly had an unlimited data plan on my Samsung Focus. ATT no longer offers that plan. When I ordered the Lumia I made sure that they would put this plan back on my Lumia when I got it. They made a note of it and after 2.5 hours on a Sunday, I felt better about it. Then when I got my phone today I called the number they instructed me to call and they put the unlimited plan back on my phone. I’m very happy that honored their promise and despite the time on the phone, I give this a 8/10. They have me the impression that they will only be doing this for customers who have had the unlimited plan for a long time. Obviously, they are trying to phase it out completely.</p>
<p><strong>Apps</strong></p>
<p>I wish the apps would go to the Zune software so when I reconnect to my PC it would just resync them on the new phone. Or with Windows Live it would be great if it noticed the apps were not there, and asked me if I wanted them to be downloaded and installed. Alas, that’s not reality. I had to go through the marketplace and try to find all the apps I had before and install them 1 at a time. The good news is that they queue them up so I can tell it to go install 50 apps. The bad news is that this process really needs to be much simpler and less user involved. Overall, a 5/10 rating for me.</p>
<p><strong>Overall Activation Process</strong></p>
<p>It took a lot of time on the phone beforehand and during the activation and setup process, which really was not fun. I’d rather be spending that time with my family. In the end, it all works, so I am happy … but I give the activation and setup process 6/10 overall simply for the many hours of effort that I had to put into it Sunday and today.</p>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Templating is a killer feature of many technologies that helps reduce code and make it more manageable and adaptable. <a href="http://www.knockoutjs.com">Knockout.js</a> has a native template engine (or you can tie in a custom templating engine), but often I like to go a bit further and load my templates from external files. In this month’s <a href="http://jpapa.me/HebUzm">Papa’s Perspective column in Visual Studio Magazine I cover the Knockout.js External Template Engine</a> and how it makes using external templates with Knockout.js a breeze. Check it out.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/ifandelse">Jim Cowart</a> wrote this library, pushed it to <a href="https://github.com/ifandelse/Knockout.js-External-Template-Engine">github</a>, and created a <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/Knockout.js_External_Template_Engine/">NuGet package</a> for it, so there’s no reason not to use it <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/External-Templates-with-KnockoutJS_7A44/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png" />. Just search for “Knockout” and you will find it in NuGet. <a href="http://jpapa.me/komvvm"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 0px" title="ko ps" border="0" alt="ko ps" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/External-Templates-with-KnockoutJS_7A44/ko%20ps_3.png" width="504" height="81" /></a></p>

    <a href="/events/javascript/jquery/2012/03/30/3-quick-javascript-tips-for-net-developers.html">3 Quick JavaScript Tips for .NET Developers</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Yesterday at the <a href="http://devconnections.com/home.aspx">DevConnections</a> event I had to make an emergency speaking appearance for a speaker who became suddenly ill. Luckily that talk was a topic I know well (JavaScript intro for .NET developers), I was available, and I didn’t freak out <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/3-Quick-JavaScript-Tips_A886/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>I grabbed the speaker’s deck and used it as a guideline, but I spent the majority of the time in <a href="http://jsfiddle.net">jsfiddle.net</a> writing examples. The audience was really interactive and grasped the basics pretty quickly. The topics that we spent the most amount of time discussing as a group where regarding namespaces, functions and objects. So I thought I might include 3 of the examples here on my blog.</p>
<h4>Namespacing</h4>
<p>Namespacing is an important (and easy) way to make sure your objects do not collide with other javascript libraries. There are many ways to handle namespacing, but the way I like to start with is dead simple. This example shows that all variables hang off the ‘my’ namespace. I like using ‘my’ because its short and sweet.</p>
<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/johnpapa/t6TBv/embedded/" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<h4>Creating an Object Literal</h4>
<p>Objects can be created in a variety of ways. But the most common you will see in demos is the object literal. The reason? Its short and sweet. Objects can be created simply by setting a variable equal to an open and close curly brace pair, as shown below. Then add properties as needed. I often use this syntax for simple objects (not a lot of logic, mostly properties and a few methods). </p>
<p>The ‘this’ keyword does work with the object literal, though once you get into nesting functions it can get unwieldy unless you manage ‘this’. That’s often when I use one of a few techniques such as setting ‘this’ (at a place where you know what ‘this’ represents for certain) to a variable called self. But I’ll hit that topic in a later post.</p>
<p>I most often use object literals for passing arguments to functions </p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/johnpapa/XNPH9/embedded/" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h4>Creating an Object from a Function</h4>
<p>You can also create objects through functions. While I prefer using a pattern such as the Revealing Module pattern for this, the simplest way to create an object from a function is shown below. Note that use of ‘self’ in here to represent ‘this’. It may not be needed in all cases but it’s a good habit to get into that has saved me many times. A friend of mine actually uses the word ’me’ instead of self … says its twice as fast <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/3-Quick-JavaScript-Tips_A886/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png" /></p>

    <a href="/asus%20ux31e/review/2012/03/23/review-of-the-asus-zenbook-ux31e.html">Review of the ASUS ZenBook UX31E</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I’ve been using my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005SY32Q2/?t=johnpanet-20">ASUS ZenBook UX31E</a> out and about for blogging, surfing, coding, and presentations for about 5 weeks now. A lot of people have commented on it with the common theme of it being a slick looking, eye catching, lightweight machine. I agree that its got the looks. The ZenBook is pretty snappy too for a i5 with 4GB of RAM and has done a very good job during presentations. When I wrote about <a href="/asusux31eunboxing">my unboxing experience</a>, I was originally bothered by the keyboard (it’s just not as fluent as Lenovo or even Vaio keyboards) and the overly “washed out” screen.&nbsp; Ultimately, I found some very good uses for the UX31E. It’s fair to note that these machines sell for around $1000 depending on varying features. So when evaluating my options I try to keep in mind that value for the cost. In this review I broke down my experiences by how I used the ZenBook.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/5-Weeks-Later-with-the-ASUS-ZenBook-UX31_7B93/WP_000530_2.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="WP_000530" border="0" alt="WP_000530" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/5-Weeks-Later-with-the-ASUS-ZenBook-UX31_7B93/WP_000530_thumb.jpg" width="244" height="184" /></a></strong></p>
<p>But first, just as a reminder…</p>
<blockquote> <p>Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above for free in the hope that I would mention it on my blog. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe my readers will enjoy. I am disclosing this in accordance with the <a href="http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_03/16cfr255_03.html">Federal Trade Commission’s 16 CFR, Part 255: “Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.”</a></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Power</strong></p>
<p>If a PC can’t handle the load, I instantly toss it aside. So did the ZenBook hold its own with my daily use? Simply put, the ZenBook handled all of my requests admirably. I suspect that the i5 and SSD had a lot to do with this as the 4GB of RAM is certainly not a lot. It handled lightweight tasks like surfing the web, blogging with Live Writer, managing email, editing photos, and playing games on the internet (that was my daughter) quite well. When I installed Visual Studio 2010 on the ZenBook I expected some bigger lags but I was pleasantly surprised in how fast it loaded and built projects. Is it as fast as my i7, 8GB RAM machines, no … but its also half the cost. Overall, I the ZenBook was fast and powerful enough for me. </p>
<p><strong>Writing Code</strong></p>
<p>I do a lot of coding, writing demos, and tinkering on the side with Visual Studio. The ZenBook had no problems keeping up with me and I was happy to code along with it. My biggest concerns were that I never quite got used to the keyboard. Maybe I’m picky, but I just didn’t get used to the feel of the keyboard and often had to go back and correct typos more often than usual. This was a problem for me when coding because my mind takes me in many directions, very quickly, and having to go back really took me out of any rhythm I could get into. I am used to nice expensive keyboards that are very responsive. Maybe I am too used to them, because my most common issue was I “missed” keys (did not press hard enough). Ultimately, because of this hurdle I could not overcome, for writing code in long blocks of time I just was not as productive with the ZenBook.</p>
<p><img alt="WP_000440" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/fdb3e10cd2a6_109A1/WP_000440_thumb.jpg" /></p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the screen does appear to be a little washed out, too. I played with the contrast quite a bit as I kept thinking that maybe it was turned up too high. I could never get it to be as sharp and colorful as I had hoped. This wasn’t a killer, but it certainly wasn’t a plus either when sitting down to write code for long periods.</p>
<p><strong>Presentations</strong></p>
<p>I took the ZenBook to several presentations and it simply excelled. First, its lightweight at less than 3 pounds so it was easy to carry around. The power supply is lightweight too, which is often a place that these tiny laptops manufacturers lack. The ZenBook also looks great, so when doing presentations I often got a lot of remarks about how nice it looked. It was certainly a topic of conversation with its shiny case. The fast start feature on the ZenBook was also great, so I could close the lid, carry it from room to room, and set back up in just a few minutes. The keyboard issues I mentioned previously did not bother me at all for this type of use as during presentations I am more deliberate about what I type. So overall, the UX31E is an ideal presentation laptop for me. The laptop comes in a nice looking case and also has a small ouch for the video out dongle.</p>

<p><strong>Family Use</strong></p>
<p>My daughter loves this laptop. I let her use it for a day and not long after she was attached to it. We have several laptops and desktops in our house along with a Windows 8 tablet from Build and an iPad 2. but the kids enjoy the laptops because they can do so much more with them. My daughter gave the ZenBook a good test by writing stories in Word, surfing the web, playing games (HTML5 and Flash based), watching videos, and doing homework (sometimes). The ZenBook fared very well for all of these uses and my daughter simply loved it. In fact, I had to tear it away from her to write the review <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/5-Weeks-Later-with-the-ASUS-ZenBook-UX31_7B93/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png" />&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sound</strong></p>
<p>I normally don’t say anything about the sound on a computer,because frankly, I don’t often use a computer’s built in speakers for music or movies. Instead, I use nice headphones or a dedicated sound system. But for being a built in sound system, the ZenBook’s sound is exceptionally good. I was very happy with the quality of the sound coming from the UX31E and found myself using it more that I ever had with a laptop.</p>

<p><strong>More on the Keyboard</strong></p>
<p>Interestingly, my daughter had the same problems with the keyboard early on, but got over them faster than I did. She no longer has any slow downs with the keyboard. I however, never got comfortable with the keyboard responsiveness. Keyboards are a personal taste, so I expect some will be fine with it and others will find the same issues I did.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>The ultimate test for me is if I still use it after a month. So do I? Yes, I found the ZenBook to be very useful for travel and presentations, but not for long periods of day to day development. I did find a hidden gem though, as the ZenBook is ideal for my oldest daughter. In fact, my younger children all eye the laptop too. So it seems that its looks and weight (kids lugging it around the house) are very appealing to families. My kids are picky too, as they get frustrated when their apps are slow (Word, email, videos) or games won’t work. They had
no such issues on the ZenBook.</p>
<p>The keyboard was a killer for me, but my family is happy about that since they now have a great laptop that they share. I’ll still use it for travel and presentations, but on all other days, its slated for my family’s use. I’ll follow up with a final conclusion in April, since I have a few more tests slated for the ZenBook.</p>

    <p>In just a few weeks I’ll be at DevConnections in Las Vegas where I’ll be presenting on a few sessions such as JsRender/JsViews, KnockoutJS, and Windows 8 Metro apps with XAML, JavaScript Patterns. These will each be a whirlwind tour of those topics, which is about all you can do in an hour. I always tell folks that I am not trying to teach everything there is to know in 1 hour …. but rather I am showing what can be done and inspire you to continue down that path, if you so choose. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.pluralsight-training.net/microsoft/Courses/TableOfContents?courseName=structuring-javascript"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/jQuery-and-Ajax-Workshop_12FD8/image_3.png" width="1049" height="220" /></a></p>
<p>For those of you who can’t make DevConnections, you’ll be glad to know that there is an excellent video training course on the JavaScript patterns by <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/dwahlin">Dan Wahlin</a> at Pluralsight titled “<a href="http://www.pluralsight-training.net/microsoft/Courses/TableOfContents?courseName=structuring-javascript">Structuring JavaScript</a>”. Dan and I subscribe to many of the same philosophies on patterns. For example, you’ll see that Dan and I are co-presenting the JavaScript Patterns session at DevConnections and in my <a href="http://jpapa.me/komvvm">KnockoutJS course for Pluralsight</a>, I use the Revealing Module Pattern heavily. (Hey, I practice what I preach.) </p>
<p>For the most in depth coverage of the patterns and how to use them properly, you should definitely check out Dan’s course. It’s chocked full of great content such as:</p>
<ol> <li><strong>Why do we Need JavaScript Patterns?</strong></li> <li><strong>Prototype Pattern</strong></li> <li><strong>Module Pattern</strong></li> <li><strong>Revealing Module Pattern</strong></li> <li><strong>Revealing Prototype Pattern</strong></li></ol>
