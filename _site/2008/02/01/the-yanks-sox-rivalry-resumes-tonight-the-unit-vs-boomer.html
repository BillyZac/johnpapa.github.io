<p>Being a die hard <a href="http://www.yankees.com">Yankee </a>fan and a baseball fan in general, I cannot wait to see the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?page=redsoxyankees">Yanks take the Red Sox on tonight </a>in the Bronx. I just hope it does not get rained out. Its just a lot of fun to watch the story unfold. And did I mention that my 6 year old knows the entire starting lineup and starting pitching of the Yankees (and has for 3 years) ? ;-) Ah, today's schools.</p>
<p>Assuming Schilling, Boomer and the Unit stay healthy all year long (all being 38 and older), it shouild be an excellent dog fight. </p>
<p>Let the countdown to opening night begin!</p>
