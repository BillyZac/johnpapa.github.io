<p>Hello,</p>

<p>My name is Virgil and I would like to ask if you see any usefulness in DocumentBurster email and report distribution software?</p>

<p>http://www.pdfburst.com/go/ci</p>

<p>DocumentBurster is a new report distribution software to automatically email hundreds or even thousands of invoices, statements or payslips to your customers, partners and employees. 
FTP upload, copy to network shared folders, web portals upload (e.g. SharePoint) and other document distribution methods are also supported. 
For filling purposes DocumentBurster can upload reports to any document management system (e.g. Documentum).</p>

<p>DocumentBurster software is already used by various companies to automate their report distribution requirements. 
You can browse some DocumentBurster case studies here - http://www.pdfburst.com/go/cs</p>

<p>I think DocumentBurster has potential for much more. That is why I’m looking to get your thoughts on DocumentBurster software?</p>

<p>Please allow me to thank you in advance for your valuable feedback. Any suggestion will be highly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thank you,
Virgil
