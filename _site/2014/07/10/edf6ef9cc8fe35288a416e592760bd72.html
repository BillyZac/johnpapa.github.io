<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I’ve been working through your Single Page Apps JumpStart on Pluralsight and I’ve come across a problem. Where do I get the fragments folder to add those folders to the solution?</p>

<p>I’ve tried downloading your final project code and adding the folders from there, but this is obviously too many steps ahead and navigating to /api/breeze/sessions gives me an error.</p>

<p>I love the style of your template and what it can do. Looks really professional!</p>

<p>All the best
Steve (Australia)
