<p>John,</p>

<p>I have taken your Pluralsight courses and had the chance to see you at DevIntersection in Florida.  The learning curve for AngularJS is a little nuts, but you have definitely helped.</p>

<p>Quick question… I want to use TypeScript for managing my Angular modules.  There is very little documentation on TypeScript/AngularJS, and I am having difficulty implementing it into your HotTowel sample code.  Further, SideWaffle isn’t much help because it doesn’t have any TypeScript templates for AngularJS.</p>

<p>Do you have any plans to do a TypeScript version of HotTowel or CodeCamper?  That would be extremely valuable just for the sample code.</p>

<p>Do you plan to do a PluralSight course that includes TypeScript/Angular?</p>

<p>I think that if you did TypeScript, you might find that the types may make it easier to communicate some Angular concepts.</p>

<p>By the way, I love that Toastr has a DefinitelyTyped definition.  It made integrating it that much easier.</p>

<p>Thanks, -Rob
