<p>Good Afternoon John,</p>

<p>First i wanted to say a big thank you for creating the Building Apps with Angular and Breeze - Part 1 and Part 2 both sections of this course have helped me immensely.   I’m just having issues with installing the HotTowel.Angular.breeze NuGet package.</p>

<p>The error i get when trying to install the package is :</p>

<p>Install-Package : Updating ‘Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Core 5.1.2’ to ‘Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Core 5.0.0’ failed. Unable to find a version of ‘Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.
OData’ that is compatible with ‘Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Core 5.0.0’.
At line:1 char:16
+ Install-Package &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  HotTowel.Angular.Breeze
    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [Install-Package], InvalidOperationException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : NuGetCmdletUnhandledException,NuGet.PowerShell.Commands.InstallPackageCommand</p>

<p>This is the second time running through this course, the first time i ran through i was able to install the package through the install-Package HotTowel.Angular.Breeze then change the versions of the issue files manually,  The problem is now i can't even install the package to get to manually updating each addon  If you'd be able to point me in the direction to fix this issue that'd be amazing.  I really want to be able to use the HotTowel packages you've created for future projects.</p>

<p>Once again, thanks for creating such a great course and i look forward to seeing what you release next</p>

<p>Regards
Bob
