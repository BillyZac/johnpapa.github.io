<p>I was trying to run ASP.NET Single Page Application template in the latest Visual studio 2013 which includes HomeTown example. It works well with IIS Express. However, when I change web server to Local IIS (Right Click project&gt; Properties&gt; Web&gt; Local IIS : project url (http://localhost/) which creates application  under Default Web Site in IIS, it doesn’t work. Once I try to register or Login, it redirects to “http://localhost/Account/Authorize?client_id=web&amp;response_type=token&amp;state=” and returns HTTP Error 404.0 - Not Found. I believe this should redirect to “http://localhost//Account/Authorize?client_id=web&amp;response_type=token&amp;state=” instead.</p>

<p>Note: It works well when project url is given as http:// which creates new site named  in IIS. But my requirement is that I have to create the application under Default Web Site, not a new site.</p>

<p>Could you please help to figure out this problem?
