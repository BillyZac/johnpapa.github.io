<p>John,</p>

<p>I am working through your HotTowel.Angular.Breeze course.  Very nice work so far.</p>

<p>I have a question.  I notice you have a vertical bar to the right of the scroll bar that shows a caution sign some times and warns you of potential javascript errors.  What add on or extension is that?  I would like to get a copy.  Anything to help reduce stupid errors, mistyping a function name, forgetting parenthesis on a function, it would be nice if something helped find those besides the F12 console.</p>

<p>Thanks.
