<p>I’ve watched a couple of your courses on Pluralsight – the Play by Play  with Ken Cenerelli and Angular JS Patterns, Clean Code.</p>

<p>While I’ve viewed a number of other courses – I get the most out of your instruction than anyone else.  However, I have a problem.  I’ll subscribe to Pluralsight for a month.  But 2 months later I might want to check on something you or another author said in their course – but I’m stuck, I have to subscribe again for maybe 5 minutes of the video I want clarification on.</p>

<p>Can I purchase your course(s) so I can view them at my leisure and timeframe?  I’ve checked the Pluralsight site but didn’t immediately find if that option were available.  Yes, I know I can hit the torrent sites but, as Maharishi Mahesh Yogi said, if you give a diamond to someone with nothing in return they will value it as just a rock.  If they must give something in return they tend to value it much more - as well as you should be compensated for your time, work, production values, etc.</p>

<p>Do I have any options?</p>
