<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I have enjoyed your PluralSight courses.</p>

<p>I am trying to do a proof of concept using AngularJS and Breeze to connect to a Microsoft Dynamics NAV Odata Source.</p>

<p>Would you have a simple app that reads a odata source with breeze and and outputs it into a table with Angular?</p>

<p>I have tried to follow the Breeze.com examples but I cannot get it to work. The odata source requires credentials and I am not sure how to pass them.</p>

<p>I would appreciate any direction you can give me.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Rick
