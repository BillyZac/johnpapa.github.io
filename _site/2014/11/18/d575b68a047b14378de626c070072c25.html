<p>John,</p>

<p>I am at Live360 and attended your Angular 0 to 60 on Monday and honestly your session made the entire trip worth while in itself.  It was very informative on Angular and how to develop Angular, designing solutions, available tools for debugging as well as the snippets that you created for web storm.  We are currently in the process of switching to Angular with a web API back end.  Well I am trying to push it.  My boss gave me a month to write an application using Angular and Web API that I initially spent 4 months writing in MVC and I was able to completely re-write it in 3 weeks thanks to your blog.  Needless to say my boss was blown away.  So thank you for providing great information and having a great presentation.</p>
