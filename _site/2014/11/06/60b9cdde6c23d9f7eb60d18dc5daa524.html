<p>John,
   First, I love your training and your Hot Towel package. You Rock!! Thank you. 
   I’m an angular novice and probably a little lazy so I have a couple questions for you. Why research when I can contact “The Wizard”!!</p>

<pre><code>	My company (large gov contractor) is just now starting a new project. It will be reproducing the functionality of a large, legacy ASP.NET Web Application for mobile devices, namely tablets. The existing web app is big and in terrible shape, but to redo or even take the time to refactor it is a very tough sell.  The new “Mobile App” will have the same, or a subset the same, functionality. It will have to run in “disconnected” mode, make changes to the data, and then update to the main data source so as to keep both systems in sync. The most likely time frame for it to be disconnected is daily maybe a little more. 
</code></pre>

<p>Being still new to angular and SPAs I’m not sure about a couple of things. Here are my questions:
•	Meeting the disconnected requirements, can we do this as an Angular (Responsive) SPA or the equal? The obvious benefit would be we can redo the main system too and get 2 for the price of one. 
•	Can you (or someone you recommend) do a consulting project and come in, make recommendations, help us architect the system and train us on Angular? I’m close on Angular and we have solid developers I think we can handle it with some tutoring.</p>

<p>To be totally honest I’m contacting you totally on my own. I have no authority and the odds of me getting this strategy adopted are thin at best. The thing is….that has never stopped me before and I see no reason to change now!! Ha!
I really appreciate what you do for our industry so keep up the good work.</p>

<p>Respectfully,
John Wright
