<p>Just found out we have a mutual colleague in Tomi Vanek… and we were talking about how baller your angular style guide is and I wanted to tell you how much I appreciate your working on that and how much time it has saved me and my team. Very well written, excellent stuff.</p>

<p>Hopefully we can work together at some point, but if not, thanks again!</p>

<p>Thanks
