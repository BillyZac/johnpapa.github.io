<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>My name is Brian Garofola and I’m an engineering director at CDK Global (formerly ADP Dealer Services).  We were a large, early adopter of AngularJS and have used it in a large ecosystem for over 2 years.  We also sponsor the AngularJS Chicago Meetup group which is now closing in on 1,000 members.  In mid-December, we are trying to plan a hackathon for the Meetup group and want it to be a great event.  We’re going to get some space in downtown Chicago, have some food &amp; beer, and give away some great prizes.  I wanted to see if you were interested in coming to judge the event.  We’re hoping that having some well-known names in the AngularJS space would help create an event better event.  Please let me know if you, or anyone else you know, might be interested.  Thanks and I look forward to speaking with you.</p>

<p>Thx,
Brian Garofola
