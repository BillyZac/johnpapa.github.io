<p>RE: SPAs, I’m going over your pluralsite SPA tutorials.
Excellent btw!</p>

<p>The one thing I can’t seem to find is how to handle User Login/Logout.</p>

<p>I’ve seen the question brought up.
I’ve googled the issue, and can’t seem to find anything except oAuth.
I’ve seen hints to ‘use a separate login page’ upon authentication, then load the SPA.  This makes sense.</p>

<p>I’ve been an mvc coder for years and know how to handle things from the server side.</p>

<p>I’m currently going over Troy Hunt’s pluralcasts.</p>

<p>Ever hear the story of how the Mongols were able to get past the Great Wall and invade China?  They bribed, then killed, one of the gate keepers.</p>

<p>A mobile SPA tied to a company server without security measures… humm, how can we exploit that?</p>

<p>Would it be possible to create an enhanced version of HotTowel which would include user login/logout for the admin functions?</p>

<p>Thanks,
PJ
