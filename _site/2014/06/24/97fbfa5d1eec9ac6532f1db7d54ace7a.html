<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>Thanks for the numerous contributions you’ve made to this field.</p>

<p>Recently I gave HotTowel Angular Breeze (v2.3.0) a test drive (I’ve used older versions in some projects) but couldn’t fetch any data from my DB using very simple Breeze queries.</p>

<p>I keep getting the following error:
The ‘query’ parameter  must be an instance of ‘EntityQuery’, or it must be a ‘string’.</p>

<p>I would be glad if you could point me in a direction to resolve this challenge ‘cause I’m at my wits end :)</p>

<p>Thanks for everything!
