<p>Condensed praise and gratitude: I want to be like John Papa when I grow up.</p>

<p>Summary: Front line developers need help deciding which frameworks to devote time on.</p>

<p>Wordy Version: There are so many js frameworks out there and I’ve taken the time to learn some in detail (knockout, amplify, require, sammy, etc…). Now I’ve been bit by the Angular and Breeze bug but hesitate to go in a new direction. During the initial learning period my productivity will decrease and I yearn for encouraging words from a trusted source expressing that it is a good choice and will pay off in the end.</p>

<p>Thanks for all your courses, they made programming fun again. All the best,
Hans
