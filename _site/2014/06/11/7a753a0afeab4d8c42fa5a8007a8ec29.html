<p>Hi John, I am very excited about your video and you modular (Avengers) example. I was able to NuGet HotTowel in with Package Manager, but could not do the same with Modular/Avengers.</p>

<p>I downloaded it and am trying to get it to run in VS2013. What is my start page?</p>

<p>I am understanding that routing calls the various HTMLs once the project is going, but I am not sure where to start.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Jim</p>

<p>PS: This video is AWESOME!!!!!
