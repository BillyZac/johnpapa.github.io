<p>Hi John. I’m trying to build my company’s web app on angular. I saw your WIP talk on the ng-conf. I thought it was great, not only the conference but the app it self.</p>

<p>I’m just starting up with angular and I was wondering if the source code of the code camper SPA app you presented there is available to inspect how you do things around there and learn how to build a SPA like that one. I didn’t manage to find that source on your git account.</p>

<p>I saw you have some online course but we’re a startup and we don’t have much budget :(</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,
kind regards</p>

<p>Roy
