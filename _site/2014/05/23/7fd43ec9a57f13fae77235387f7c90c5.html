<p>Hello John.  Thank you so much for creating the Hot Towel SPA template.  I was just wondering what the restrictions of use are.  I was hoping to use the template to make a complete site for my aunts new bakery.  I was wondering if I am able to use the template in its entirety only making changes (many many changes) to make it our own.  I will of course credit you on the site as the template creator.  Please let me know when you have time.  Thanks.
Shawn
