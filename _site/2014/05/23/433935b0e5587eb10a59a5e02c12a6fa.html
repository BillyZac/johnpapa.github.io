<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I followed your knockout tutorial in pluralsight with the CodeCamper app.
I really like the UOW en repository setup of the project.</p>

<p>Now I want to create unit tests.
I can simply replace the Name of the DbContext so I have an integration test with a real db. That works fine.</p>

<p>I would like to do something like: 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn314431.aspx</p>

<p>This isn’t possible with the EFRepository of CodeCamper.
Is the EFRepository not the best way to go with EF6 because of the use of DbContext Set en Entry()?</p>

<p>thank you for some remarks on it</p>
