<p>Hey John, I was hoping to connect with you at Anglebrackets in Orlando but was not able to attend your AngularJS workshop. Is there a link that you could share with me to download all that material? I’m looking for some good starting points for AngularJS, Breeze, and WebAPI. I’m new to all these and I want to know how I can use all of them to create web apps. Currently, I’m deep in MVC 4 and want to see how I can use these technologies too.</p>

<p>Thanks,
Kyle
