<p>John,</p>

<p>Great pluralsight course ‘Building Apps with Angular and Breeze’ by the way</p>

<p>However, I’m stuck at the relatively early point of just trying the get the Breeze component to return metadata - the course portion before moving into extending the app.  I’ve checked routes, started from scratch 3 times, etc.  but whenever i try to go to the ‘/breeze/breeze/metadata’ it does not return metadata and just reverts to the default Dashboard view. I’ve tried a ‘/’ in front of “breeze/Breeze” remoteServiceName in the config.js, I’ve tried using ‘…/breeze/Breeze/metadata’ with the second B capitalized, I’ve tried “…/breeze/Breeze/Metadata’, I’ve tried using Ping instead of Metadata, etc.  Nothing returns and things just revert to the Dashboard view.  The only thing abnormal during the entire process up to that point was the VS warning (below) but the solution did not work (return metadata) before nor after VS made the redirect.  I’m using VS2013 Ultimate.</p>

<p>Any advise would really be helpful.</p>

<p>Thank you,
Patrick</p>
