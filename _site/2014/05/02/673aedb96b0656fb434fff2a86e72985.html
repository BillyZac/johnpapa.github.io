<p>Hi John,  Please disregard my previous email!  I realized that the # was still within the url that I was appending ‘breeze/breeze/metadata’ to and didn’t realize until looking closely at the video that you pasted a url without the hash.</p>

<p>Oh well learned a lot in digging into the breeze/ef/webapi2 areas.</p>

<p>Now off to more Hot Towel!!</p>

<p>Thanks, 
Patrick
