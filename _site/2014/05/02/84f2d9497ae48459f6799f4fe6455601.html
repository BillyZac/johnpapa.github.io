<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I am a pluralsight subscriber, love your courses, I need your opinion on what technology I should concentrate for future.</p>

<p>My background, .NET developer with 10 years of web development experience working for various organizations in Atlanta area. Currently I am in job market looking for a job, I am debating what type of jobs to target:
- native development(I know android, working on app, have not published yet) 
- mobile web and hybrid apps(responsive web, phonegap) 
- web development(Angular, backbone etc).</p>

<p>Biggest worry I have, dont want to spend time learning which might not have too many jobs in future, dont want to pigeon hole myself:0</p>

<p>I will appreciate any help on this.</p>

<p>Thanks!
