<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>Hope you remember me from a nerddinner meetup in Orlando. Please do write  a step by step article for simple WebAPI2 + Breeze Server configuration. There isn’t one and one on Pluralsight talks less of this server side configuration and more of angularjs or client side.</p>

<p>Thanks and regards,
Pooran
