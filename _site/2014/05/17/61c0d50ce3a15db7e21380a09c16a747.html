<p>Hello Sir,</p>

<p>I just started to develop SPA from scratch after watching your great course Angular And Breeze part1 and 2. Currently working on backend and trying to make my web api secure so only authenticated user access to it. I want to have Token Based authentication using Identity v2.</p>

<p>As you know that Identity v2 Sample does not have any Token Authentication, so I manually set up by myself, everything looks good to me, the only problem I am running through from the last 5,6 days, /Token end point can’t be accessible which suppose to be expose by Owin Middleware. Can you please put your suggestion in answer to this question</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Regards,
Ammar
