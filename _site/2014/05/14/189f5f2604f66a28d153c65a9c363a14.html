<p>John,</p>

<p>Are you available for a small project to build sample project using your SPA techniques and an admin template from WrapBootStrap?  We are using the following template for an internal project:</p>

<p>https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/smartadmin-responsive-webapp-WB0573SK0</p>

<p>Would like to get the template converted over to SPA solution on .Net.  Completely open to front end libraries (Angular, Asp.Net MVC) but really need assistance with creating framework for data access in SQL Server environment.  I am mainly needing examples created within the template that I can share with internal team to build out content from there.  Is this something you would be interested in?</p>

<p>Thanks,
Kevin Brown
