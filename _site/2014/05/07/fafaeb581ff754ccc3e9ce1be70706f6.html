<p>Opps, typo be me. Please ignore my last message. Im an idiot.</p>

<p>Just FYI, I watched your course on Building a SPA app for SharePoint 2013.</p>

<p>MATE!!!!! This was freaken AWESOME!!!!   I would seriously love to see more in this space if you can ever manage it.</p>

<p>I would love to know how I could hook up to say a MongoDB on the cloud to persist data whilst working in SharePoint.</p>

<p>SP tables dont seem like a realistic place to build up a complex app. Unless you think its possible? Would be interested on your opinion here.</p>

<p>Anyways John, keep up the awesome work. You are a true hero in this scene. Thanks so much for all your hard work, skill and talent.</p>

<p>I’ll be watching everything you produce. And again like I said, I love your courses on pluralsight. Im happy to be a permanant subscriber just for your content alone.</p>

<p>Kind Regards</p>
