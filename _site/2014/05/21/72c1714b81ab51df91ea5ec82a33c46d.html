<p>John,</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of being introduced to your material at DevIntersection in Orlando, and am now taking your PluralSight course.</p>

<p>One topic that I cannot seem to find addressed anywhere (so far) is multi-tenancy in Breeze/EF.  I know that Breeze has its own magic that it works with EF.  Are there any potential gotchas?  What is the best way to implement it?</p>

<p>By “multi-tenancy”, I mean that we have multiple backend databases.  Each customer has their own database.</p>

<p>Thanks for being the guru, and blazing the trail!</p>

<p>-Rob
