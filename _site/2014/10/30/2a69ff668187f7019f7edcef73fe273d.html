<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>My name is Hugo Girard, I’m an IT Director at the company Patientel and I have a big question for the expert of Angular.js.</p>

<p>We have a big SPA application we need to create and ship for next year, but I read some blog about big changes in Angular.js 2.0 versus 1.3.</p>

<p>We started to write last month the software with 1.3 and kind of worry we will have a crazy migration path 1.3 to 2.0.</p>

<p>Reading some blog, some people were complaining so because we’re in an early stage I will like to have your opinion.</p>

<p>Thanks
