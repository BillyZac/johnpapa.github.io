<p>I have an ERP project to implement in which i have over 11 modules i.e(Sales &amp; Purchase,HR,Finance,Production ,etc)  for all modules I have one Database I am hosting Web Apis seperatly for each module means For HR I am going to develope seperate Web Api project and going to access it say</p>

<p>www.myerp.hr.com/–/—  similarly for all others</p>

<p>My question is when I have only one database but 11 seperate Web Apis how should I go through implementing security for my application where my client would be purely javascript based.</p>

<p>Should I have to  code AccountController in every module and validate it or I should code validation I mean AccountController in only one module then how will I secure other modules say I programed 
user validation logics in only   myerp.hr.com/api/account/–  then when I will send request to</p>

<p>myerp.sales.com/–/–/  how will it work.how will  my sales module api know it that user is already authenticated from myerp.hr.com/api/account/–</p>
