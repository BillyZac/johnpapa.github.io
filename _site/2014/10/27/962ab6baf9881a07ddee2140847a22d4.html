<p>Hi John big fan of your work,</p>

<p>I currently use knockout, sammy and breeze to my front end in all my projects for about 2-3 years, and a little durandal in small projects.</p>

<p>I serius thinking in migrate my front end architecture to angular because i feel like angular is goin to become the new standar di facto in web application.</p>

<p>What is your recomendation about this?
