<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I have begun to examine Typescript to see if it may help some of the JavaScript non-OO anxiety here where I work. We are issued Windows 7 workstations with Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate Update 3 installed, although there are also a lot of security settings and software installed which occasionally interferes with basic VS functions.</p>

<p>I’ve been trying to work through some basic examples of using AMD modules in Typescript, but have had nothing but problems. I finally saw in section 4.11 (“Importing External Modules using AMD”) of your Pluralsight video, “Typescript Fundamentals” in which you make a setting change for Web Essentials (Tools &gt; Options &gt; Web Essentials &gt; Typescript &gt; Compiler Flags &gt; Use the AMD Module).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my VS installation does not offer that configuration option. I have tried to add the “–module AMD” compile option in every place I could under the project build types of settings, to no avail. I have uninstalled and reinstalled Web Essentials 3 times, but still I am not presented with the same configuration option as in your video. I’m guessing that the video shows you working in VS 2012, and the configuration you show is now more deeply integrated with VS 2013. Nowhere do I see a call to the “tsc” compiler.</p>

<p>Do you know where under VS 2013 I would tell the Typescript compiler to use “–module AMD”?</p>

<p>Thanks, and I really enjoy your work in its many varied forms,
Mark Humphrey
