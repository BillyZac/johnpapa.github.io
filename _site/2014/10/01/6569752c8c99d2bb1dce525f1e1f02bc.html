<p>Hi John,
Big fan of your AngularJS styleguide. I’m an engineering lead at a well funded startup called InVisionApp. We are 100% work-from-home (we have no office at all) and we’re looking for a senior FE developer to do crazy awesome things. Not sure if you’re currently looking for a position, but if you are, let me know.</p>

<p>Thanks!
