<p>I have a quick question about your AngularJS style guide’s suggestion for services at: https://github.com/johnpapa/angularjs-styleguide#services</p>

<p>In your example, you use the revealing module pattern to expose the functions and data. This works fine, unless the reference of the data being revealed is changed. In that situation, a controller which may expose the service’s data for binding won’t reflect the change.</p>

<p>Here’s an example: http://jsfiddle.net/BrianVallelunga/cccmu6mb/</p>

<p>In my example, I can change a member of the service’s data just fine, but not completely replace the data object itself. If I need to swap out the data object itself from within the service, how do you recommend doing this?</p>

<p>I’m sure you’re busy, but thanks for any time you give on this. If this is a common problem, maybe it could be added to the style guide.
