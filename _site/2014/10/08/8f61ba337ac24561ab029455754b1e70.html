<p>John,</p>

<p>I’m working with your pattern for repositories where we extend the abstract repo to create new repos.  I’m running into a problem where I want to instantiate the new repo and inject a variable in the process.  Let me explain…</p>

<p>I have a variable called “database”</p>

<p>var database = {
            name: ‘CardContext’,
            $context: null,
            get exists() {
                if (localStorage.getItem(this.name)) {
                    return true;
                }
                else {
                    return false;
                }
            },
            get context() {
                if (!this.$context) {
                    this.$context = new $ect.Types.EctCardContext({ name: “LocalStore”, databaseName: this.name })
                }
                return this.$context;
            },
        };</p>

<p>Right now the “name” variable is hard coded to ‘cardContext’.  I want to be able to inject that name when I new up the repo.  In fact I would like to put this variable inside the abstract class so I can just call it from my repo.  I’m having an issue though being able to do this.  Could you lend some support?</p>

<p>Thanks
Matt
