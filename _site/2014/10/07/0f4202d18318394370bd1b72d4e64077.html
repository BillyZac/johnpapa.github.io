<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I attended live 360 a few years back and sat in on your session regarding single page applications and I thought it was great. I also see that you’ll be doing a workshop this year on angular. I’ve been looking forward to this but there’s actually a chance I may not be able to attend for logistical reasons.</p>

<p>But I wanted to know if you doing any other events in the near future similar to the workshop that you’ll be doing at live? I would really like to attend as I enjoy your style of presentation and your knowledge. Thanks
