<p>Hi John -
Nice to e-meet you.  My name is Renee and I am the Director of Marketing at Backand.  I am in touch with Joe Eames regarding sponsoring the ng-conf next year and he suggested that I reach out.</p>

<p>Backand is a Backend as a Service (BaaS) platform for Angular.  We are new to the Angular market, but have been on the backend scene for several years.    We are interested in creating a course on what we do and how we help Angular developers.  Can you give me some ideas on how we go about doing this?  Also, we would love to get feedback on our product, on-boarding, use cases, etc.  Would this be something you do or can you suggest someone who does this kind of thing?</p>

<p>I appreciate your time and look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience!
Cheers -
Renee
