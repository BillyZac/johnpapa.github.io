<p>Hi John, I’m really enjoying your latest video on Clean Code / Angular that you for posted on Pluralsight.  We are going to be learning a lot from your styles guide as well.  Thank you.</p>

<p>I have been using VS2013 but am also curious about using Sublime and have just tried downloading your Sublime / Angular snippets but it’s a zip file with snippets in it and I believe the Sublime / Packages folder is expecting a Package file?  I tried unzipping and putting the individual snippet files in the packages directory but that does not seem to be getting recognized by Sublime.</p>
