<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>In the last days I started to get interested in Angularjs. I have seen your pluralsight video with Ken Cenerelli that is a really good introduction to Angular, but one thing that comes into my mind and I didn’t catch yet, is about what it’s called MEAN stack. I know that you didn’t talk about it in your videos, but if I search about Angular I constantly see this term. 
Well I understand M and the N, Angular is a “client’s thing” and someone needs to deliver the files to the client, so nodejs [and because it’s javascript it’s a easy choice, we keep the same language between the client and server], and if we need to save some data we choose the MongoDB and again we keep the same language across this layers. But my question is:</p>

<p>Why do we need something like jade and express?
Can you give me some examples when I should just keep with Angular and other scenario when it’s better to have express and jade to help?</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<p>PS: Sorry for my bad english.
Regards
