<p>Hello, how are you doing Mr John Papa?, I was wondering if you would/could help me :D, I’ve developed a web app using Hot Towel, but now there’s the need to “embed” a html5/canvas interactive area into it, and It doesn’t seem to be working, I’m still working out a solution and/but I’m reaching a important deadline this friday.</p>

<p>I’d happily pay for your assistance :D
