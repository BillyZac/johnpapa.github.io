<p>Hi,
Watching the Pluralsight SPA training video and would like to download the example code. I did find two versions online one using breezejs and the other looks like the one used within the Pluralsight video but its not complete. Any idea where I can download the full working version?</p>

<p>Thanks,
Garry
