<p>Hello John,</p>

<p>I am just starting out with client side development using MVVM, Knockout, Require, Sammy, Amplify however I have been a .Net Server Side developer for many years. I am currently watching two of your video courses on Pluralsight: First; Building HTML5 and JavaScript Apps with MVVM and Knockout, Second; Single Page Apps with HTML5, Web API, Knockout and jQuery</p>

<p>The first course introduces namespaces for javascript modules which I like that concept. The second course covers the use of Require.js for module dependancy. However, my question is: I can’t seem to find an example of using namespaces and require.js</p>

<p>Could you point me to or show me an example of how I would say implement a my.customerViewModel and still use Require.js to resolve dependencies.</p>

<p>I want to really thank you for making such great quality courses. They have already been a great asset to me!</p>

<p>Regards,</p>
