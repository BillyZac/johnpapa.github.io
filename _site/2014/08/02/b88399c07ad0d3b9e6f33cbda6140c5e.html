<p>Hi. First of all thanks for the great courses on Pluralsight. I just wanted to tell you, and ask you, if it’s ok that I have created a version of your HotTowel angular breeze nuget package written in typescript and posted it on nuget. If you want you can have a look yourself: 
https://www.nuget.org/packages/HotTowelTypescript/</p>

<p>I’ll of course remove or rename it if you have any problems with that. Just let me know :)</p>

<p>Best regards Carl Fredrik Samson
