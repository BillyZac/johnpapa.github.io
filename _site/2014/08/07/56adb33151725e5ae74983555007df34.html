<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>Really liked your angular style guide - awesome repo with a lot of great content for people new and experienced with angular.</p>

<p>I wanted to reach out to you because my company, HackHands, is an online service to help developers get support from other developers in real time.  We have a sizable community of followers who would love to learn more about how to better program using resources like your repo.</p>

<p>Would you be interested in writing a blog post tutorial about angular for our audience? This blog post would be useful for getting additional exposure to you, your repo, and even your classes on Pluralsight. We’d promote you on twitter, Facebook, to our newsletter, and more. Additionally, we would also pay you for any time you spent preparing the content.</p>

<p>If you’re up for this, I will help as much as possible with making the logistics easy and convenient for you.  I can also help with editing to make sure it sounds good and smooth :)</p>

<p>Let me know!</p>

<p>Best,
