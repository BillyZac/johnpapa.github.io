<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I was wondering whether I could seek your assistance regarding a silverlight project I am working on. It is a Silverlight4 application  using MVVM and NHibernate. The major issue I have is that the application relies on datagrids and DataForms for CRUD operations. in a master- details scenario. The issue I have is that the EditItemTemplate works for updating the records however when it comes to adding new items through the NewItemTemplate I do get an exception to the effect that the first property I will be trying to extract does not bind. I can post my code but knowing as you are quite a busy person I would understand if you cannot find the time.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>
