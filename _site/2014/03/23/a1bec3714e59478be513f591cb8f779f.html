<p>Hi John, good to talk with you and your wife today. Real quick question, is there any organized online effort underway (Facebook, mailing lists, etc.) where people interested in getting this high school situation resolved are gathering? I’m all about going to commissioner meetings and speaking, or whatever it takes, but if there’s a concerted effort that’s more coordinated and strategic, I’m willing to buy into that. My neighborhood is similarly minded, where I bet 80% of families have young children, and they’re already activists just to get the developer to build a playground. I can get them fired up as well!</p>

<p>Thanks again,
-Jeff
