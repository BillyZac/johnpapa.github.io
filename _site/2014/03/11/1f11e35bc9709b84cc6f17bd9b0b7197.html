<p>Hey John.</p>

<p>I just recently learned of the code academy, which is taking place in Orlando two Saturdays from now, and that you will be the key speaker.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I have another appointment that day, so I most likely won’t be able to attend.  I’m wondering if videos of the speakers will be available (even for a small fee) to be watched later by people who couldn’t attend, but wanted to?</p>

<p>thanks.</p>

<p>sincerely,</p>
