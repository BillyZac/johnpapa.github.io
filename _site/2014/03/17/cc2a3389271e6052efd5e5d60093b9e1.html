<p>Hello Mr. Papa,</p>

<p>This comment is about HotTowel.Angular.Breeze.</p>

<p>I’m really new to both Angular and Breeze so please forgive my ignorance.</p>

<p>In, http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/sites/htngz/readme/readme.html, should q.js also be added?</p>

<p>I couldn’t figure out where to call ‘config.breeze’, so I set it as a dependency/passed in value to entityManagerFactory. That seemed to setup the .to$q function from the PluralSight video (Promises and Q).</p>

<p>Thanks for the NuGet package and all the documentation. I couldn’t imagine trying to learn this without it.
