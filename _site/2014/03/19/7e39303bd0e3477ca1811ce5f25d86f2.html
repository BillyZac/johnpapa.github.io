<p>John, I’m trying to follow your Building Apps with Angular and Breeze course and I’m trying to add a new view.</p>

<p>The new view I’m adding is a few levels down in the folder hierarchy at
app/controllers/reports/transactionReport/transactionReport.html</p>

<p>This seems to present an issue for the config.route.js.  I can add the sessions view just fine at the level that you add it at, but when I try to add one more levels down it just doesn’t show up.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?
