<p>Hi John, I was wondering if you could point us in the right direction with this problem I posted on stackoverflow. I’ve tried a few things but none seem to eliminate this error. I get this config not defined error in the browser when opening the sessions view of your pluralsight course with the updated Hot Towel angular breeze template.</p>

<p>Great course.</p>

<p>Thank you
Denis
