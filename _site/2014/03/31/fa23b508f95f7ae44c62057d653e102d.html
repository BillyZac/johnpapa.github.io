<p>Papa,</p>

<p>I’m looking to develop a SPA design pattern for my company.  What I would like to do is follow a similar design patter that Microsoft attempted years ago called CAB.  (Composite Application Block)</p>

<p>At the time I felt it was far to complex and when we implemented it we found making changes was too expensive and our estimates were always way off.</p>

<p>I feel like the SPA model lends itself much better for the approach I want.</p>

<p>I literally want every application in my company written as a SPA but I want a single “Core” project that each SPA uses.  The goal is to create a Composite Application experience for the users, IE: They would load one application and it would offer, via menu, all the apps they are allowed to use.  For developers we can develop in independent solutions with only the “Core” project and our applications individual MVVM templates.</p>

<p>Thoughts?  Do you know how I can do this?</p>

<p>Thanks,
Bob
