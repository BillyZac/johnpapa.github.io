<p>I worked my way through most of your pluralsight spa training and also recently found and watched your teched na 2013 compressed version where you referenced the following shortened url http://jpapa.me/hottowel which appears to be broken.  I’m assuming it was meant to point to http://www.johnpapa.net/hottowel/ right?</p>

<p>The subject of angular vs durandal has lots of search hits with opinions these days.  Watching your talks and reading your http://www.johnpapa.net/ posts it seems that in 2013 you were seeing durandal/mvvm spa framework as the preferred choice but now your 2014 posts seem to suggest you moving more towards the angular/mvc spa framework option. Any updated thoughts on this?  It would seem the durandal option given its leverage of existing well understood knockout for data bindings and the mvvm UI design pattern aligns better with folks coming from a silverlight spa background would you agree?</p>

<p>The http://www.johnpapa.net/hottowel/ vsix installed project templates for vs13 was last updated on 9/4/2013 and appears to extend visual c# | web | visual studio 2012 | asp.net mvc4 project template set and not the visual c# | web [ visual studio 2013 ] project template setup.  Is anything in the works to provide a hot towel project extension that extends the vs13 asp.net based mvc and owin katana based spa project templates?
