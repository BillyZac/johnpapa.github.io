<p>I was wondering if you would have time to be a technical reviewer on a new book I’m working on with Packt Publishing on AngularJS Services.</p>

<p>If you are interested please reply with your preferred email address so I can forward it to my editorial team at Packt Publishing.</p>

<p>I’ll also send you the book’s outline so you can get an idea of what I’ll be covering.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Jim Lavin
