<p>Of course so far my repository of ProductVersionIssues is pulling through the username when I really need it to pull through the Display name and thus I need to link tables. Then when pushing the data back down if the TechSupportGuy has changes I need to save back the username rather than the Display name. Any guidance how I might achieve this?</p>

<p>Rgds</p>
