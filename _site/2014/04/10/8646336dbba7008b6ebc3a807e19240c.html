<p>I am learning SPA and using HotTowel to build my new site using ASP.NET WEBAPI2. I was going through the Jump Start SPA code sample and found that you are using Breeze controllers. All API code especially the metadata stuff depends upon Code first entity framework model. What if someone has more complex data structure which is existing and the data access code is already written using say Microsoft Data Access Blocks with Stored procedures. And then the returned data is converted in objects of POCO class. How we will return the metadata in this case? I am stuck at this point. Can you please provide some help, urgently?
