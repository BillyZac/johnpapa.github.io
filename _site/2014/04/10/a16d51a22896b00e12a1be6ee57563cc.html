<p>Hi John</p>

<p>I’m putting together a SPA with the help of your tips and courses. However I have a small issue with Authentication. I have got Authentication working using the Katana / Owin stuff inside the SPA. However I want to use a landing page outside the SPA structure which will allow the user to login and then be taken into the SPA. The landing page is part of the project but running with an MVC controller. Now as I’m sure you know the MVC template uses different authentication code from the WebAPI and SPA template. I have integrated this code so I am ( I think) using Bearer token authentication on the  login page but haven’t quite got it to work when transferring over to the SPA.</p>

<p>My question to you is this:</p>

<p>Is it a reasonable idea to authenticate through a separate landing page like this and can it be made to work using Bearer Token OAuth or am I headed down the wrong path?</p>

<p>I do think it would be a great idea if you were to add some Authentication to your SPA course. Admittedly it does seem to be a case of moving targets at the moment with all the changes that are happening in the code but then I guess that applies to everything.</p>

<p>Regards</p>
