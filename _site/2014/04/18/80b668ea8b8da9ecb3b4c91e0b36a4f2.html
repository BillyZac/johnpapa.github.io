<p>Hello John,</p>

<p>First of all I want to thank you for the great tutorials at pluralsight! 
They’re really great!</p>

<p>If it’s not so difficult for you could you please send me the final visual studio project of the following tutorial?</p>

<p>http://www.pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/build-apps-angular-breeze-part2</p>

<p>I’ve found only scratch project at http://jpapa.me/pccngzextra (I saw the link in your tutorial).</p>

<p>I need a sample for breeze-angular WIP functionality and your example seems to be perfect for it.
My problem is that I don’t have time to follow full tutorial (10+ hours) and write all step by step.</p>

<p>I would really appreciate your help.</p>

<p>Best regards,
Oleksandr Zinchenko
