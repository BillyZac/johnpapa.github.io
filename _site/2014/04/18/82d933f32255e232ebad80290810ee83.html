<p>Hey John,</p>

<p>I’m starting your course on Angular and Breeze on Pluralsight (one of the reasons I got my subscription!) and I’m having an issue when trying to access the metada on the Breeze controller. I have built everything you have said in the tutorial two times now and when I try to access http://localhost/breeze/breeze/metadata I get the following error:</p>

<p>This XML file does not appear to have any style information associated with it. The document tree is shown below.</p>

<p>An error has occurred.</p>

<p>Could not load file or assembly ‘Microsoft.Data.OData, Version=5.6.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35’ or one of its dependencies. The located assembly’s manifest definition does not match the assembly reference. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)</p>

<p>System.IO.FileLoadException</p>

<p>at System.Web.Http.OData.ODataFormattingAttribute.Initialize(HttpControllerSettings controllerSettings, HttpControllerDescriptor controllerDescriptor) at System.Web.Http.Controllers.HttpControllerDescriptor.InvokeAttributesOnControllerType(HttpControllerDescriptor controllerDescriptor, Type type) at System.Web.Http.Controllers.HttpControllerDescriptor.InvokeAttributesOnControllerType(HttpControllerDescriptor controllerDescriptor, Type type) at System.Web.Http.Controllers.HttpControllerDescriptor.Initialize() at System.Web.Http.Controllers.HttpControllerDescriptor..ctor(HttpConfiguration configuration, String controllerName, Type controllerType) at System.Web.Http.Dispatcher.DefaultHttpControllerSelector.InitializeControllerInfoCache() at System.Lazy<code>1.CreateValue() at System.Lazy</code>1.LazyInitValue() at System.Lazy`1.get_Value() at System.Web.Http.Dispatcher.DefaultHttpControllerSelector.SelectController(HttpRequestMessage request) at System.Web.Http.Dispatcher.HttpControllerDispatcher.SendAsyncCore(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken) at System.Web.Http.Dispatcher.HttpControllerDispatcher.d__0.MoveNext()</p>

<p>It’s obvious that there is something wrong with the version of OData but I try to uninstall and re-install an older version (including re-install of the other dependent packages) and I get the same types of results. Also, I’m using Visual Studio 2013. Any idea what can be wrong?
