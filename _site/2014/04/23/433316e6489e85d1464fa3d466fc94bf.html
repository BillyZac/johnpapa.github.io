<p>Hi:</p>

<p>We are trying to build up a new web application for supporting different business silos that will be used across the enterprise.</p>

<p>We would like to standardize our process to use Angular for the Web UI/UX design. To this end we wanted to organize a training session at our site where we can jump start the training of a number of our software engineers on new technology to jump start the process and get everyone on the same page.</p>

<p>Your name was mentioned as a phenomenal evangelist for all JS technologies, and I was wondering if you have any experience or recommendation for organizing on-site training on Java Script technologies.</p>

<p>Thank you very much, and I look forward to hearing from you (I hope!!)</p>

<p>Sincerely</p>
