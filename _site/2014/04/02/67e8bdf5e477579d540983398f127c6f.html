<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I need to ask a question about spinner , I need to add the spinner (ONLY) when the user types the url of partial view directory for example localhost:4440/#/sessions, if user types this directly without going through the home page first , this will not activate the spinner and this will not activate routeChangeStart even, so I need your help in this issue
