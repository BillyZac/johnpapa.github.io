<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I’m trying to follow Angular JS Style guide that you’ve published.</p>

<p>I have one question regarding topic in the guide: “Resolving Promises for a Controller”</p>

<p>What if I need to call getMovies function with some parameter that user generated in previous route?</p>

<p>One possible solution is to use $rooteScope.id= ‘1’, in that case I can pass param via $rootScope mechanism.</p>

<p>But what if need to pass parameter that I’ll be able to take when user accessed certain controller. Let say I want to call my service that returns venues based on latitude and longitude in that case I think it would be ok to create helper function inside <code>resolve:{}</code>, to get lat and lon and pass it to the function.</p>

<p>What do you think, and what is the best practice on your mind to manage such cases?
// without js
Thanks,
Julian
