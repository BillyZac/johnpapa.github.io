<p>You seem to know what you’re talking about and you’re <em>actually</em> funny. That’s rare for a geek ;)</p>

<p>I’ve watched quite a few of your angularjs talks (very new to it, .net background), and I must admit your delivery is by far the best I’ve seen and most engaging (so far - don’t get too big headed ;). I’m quite curious about the tenth item omitted from the code on the beach talk, I think you either: didn’t think the audience could handle it, you couldn’t handle delivering it or maybe you just can’t count? :P</p>

<p>Anyway keep up with the good material :)
