<p>Hi John -</p>

<p>I was reading how you are doing your new podcast for Angular, and I’m sure you and your co-host are probably always breaking your brains for new content. I am currently working on a very large enterprise level AngularJS application for CenturyLink. I’m the sole front end dev. on it, and I have learned a lot in the process with an application this size. Our planned launch is end of year.</p>

<p>I’d be more than happy to further discuss the possibility of being on the show, if you are at all interested, for some topic/topics. I actually gave a meetup presentation on Angular in the Enterprise about 2 or so months ago that I could generate some content ideas from if necessary.</p>

<p>I noticed on your github profile that your based in Orlando. I’m actually going to be in Orlando next weekend with my wife and son on a short out of town trip, and I could meet you for coffee even, to discuss further in person. Thoughts?</p>

<p>Anyways, hope this message receives you well.</p>

<p>Thanks,
Stephen
