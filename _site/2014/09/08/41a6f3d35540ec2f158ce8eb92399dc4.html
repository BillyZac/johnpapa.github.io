<p>Hey John – 
First thanks for all the great training on Plural sight, Pod Casts, Blog etc.<br />
I wanted to clarify one artifact of SPA Design that is important to my current project but I don’t see being discussed.  I want to make a disconnected Line of Business application.  Generally following your plural sight example “Building Apps with Angular and Breeze”.  The issue is with WIP storage, Local Storage and or IndexedDB are browser specific repositories.  The general sensoria is Representative Sync there machine daily or weekly then take orders in the field that will be persisted back to the central system by syncing in the office only.  User opens the app in Chrome adds some data.  Closes there computer and travels to the next client when they open the application in I.E. and add some data.  Now there are two separate repositories for the WIP data.<br />
This would mean the user would need to sync under each browser but would also not see all changes in either one. The method that seams most available to address this is to simply only allow it to run under one browser but that is a little lame in that the application could run fine on almost any browser.</p>

<p>Thanks for your thoughts
Dan
