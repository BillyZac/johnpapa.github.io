<p>Hi John Papa!
Thank you so much for your contributions to “Adventures in Angular”
The build process chapter, inspired me to write a Gulp plugin to add my Angular module dependencies automatically to my main app.js file.</p>

<p>It works great in combination with gulp watch, livereload and ng-inject.
This is the link: https://github.com/yagoferrer/gulp-ng-inject 
Check it out!</p>

<p>BTW I’m using your style guide in one of our projects at my company. I love it!
Thanks again!</p>
