<p>Hi John, I’m working at a software company that has recently gotten into marrying angularjs with our web api backend.  Our current approach is to use a ‘hybrid’ approach to making an angular spa by hosting pages that contain angular apps from a mvc middle layer.  We then are consuming our web api by routing through our mvc controllers in a very ‘ajax’-ey manner.  Ideally, I would like to be able to remove our mvc middle layer and consume our web api in a purely angular manner.  One issue that has come up however is authentication since normally we use mvc to handle most of our session and authentication needs.  We’ve considered a few different approaches including token based authentication, but it seems that some responsibilities need to be given to the server.  I was hoping for some insight on practical approaches to handling authentication.</p>

<p>Do you have any insight to offer on the correct way to consume a web api from a purely angular manner?  And, if so, what are some options in doing so in a secure way?  Thanks for your time, and I hope this was formatted well enough that you understand our current scenario.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>~Thomas
