<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I just wanted to let you know that I used your “Keep It Simple RequireJS” sample as a basis for a blog post on using TypeScript with RequireJS:</p>

<p>http://icanmakethiswork.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/typescript-and-requirejs-keep-it-simple.html</p>

<p>I’ve been clear to credit you but I thought it might be good manners to let you know. I hope that’s okay - if you’d like any amends then let me know.</p>

<p>I love your work with Pluralsight by the way - fantastic courses!</p>

<p>Best
John
