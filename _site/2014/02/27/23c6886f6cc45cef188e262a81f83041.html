<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>After long weeks of frustration and even abandoning the project a couple of times, I finally implemented completely asp.net webapi simple authentication using angular with an 1 page app here:</p>

<p>whatineed.azurewebsites.net</p>

<p>It was a battle, but at the end I can say I really groc spa security issues.</p>

<p>This site is a work in progress, I just wanted to show off a bit what can be achieved using the angular/webapi combo. The part that really makes me happy is that this was a 1 time thing, all of my future projects will be based on this template I built.</p>

<p>Your friend,</p>
