<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>Thanks very much for taking a moment and reading this.</p>

<p>I’m going through your Single Page Apps Jumpstart tutorial on Pluralsight.  In the section titled “SPA from Scratch”, in video “Preparing the Server Code”, timeframe of 15 seconds into the video, you mention “…look inside of the folder structure for the Code for this module you will see an After, Before and Resources Folder…”</p>

<p>How did you access those?  I can’t find them at all.  I right mouse click the project and choose “Open Folder in File Explorer” and it brings me to the root folder for the project as expected.  I have searched for the After, Before and Resources folders but cannot find them anywhere.</p>

<p>Could you please explain how you opened that explorer window to show the Code folder with the After, Begin and Resources subfolders?</p>

<p>I am really looking forward to going through your tutorials but cannot get past this piece.</p>

<p>thank you very much…</p>

<p>Dave
