<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>My name is Paul Pardi and I work in the developer evangelism group at Microsoft in the training division. We’re currently working on a course on TypeScript and we’re looking for SMEs that can help us with content dev and do some video presentations for us. I’ve been talking with Jonathan Turner and he told me to check out your course on PluralSight. The course looks good and I’d like to chat with you about what we need and what your availability might be.</p>

<p>If you could get back to me at paulp@microsoft.com and let me know if you’re interested in chatting, I’ll find time for a call.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Paul
