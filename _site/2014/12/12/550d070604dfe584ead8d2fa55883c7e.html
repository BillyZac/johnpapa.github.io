<p>Hi there John,</p>

<p>I just found Toaster today and I love it! Easy to use and I will definitely use it in all my future projects.</p>

<p>Sorry to do this, but I had a question…</p>

<p>I don’t have much experienced with javascript or jquery (I know - BIG disadvantage!) but I was wondering how I could add more of the jquery animations to Toastr?</p>

<p>For example, I think the fold animation would look really slick!</p>

<p>Thans again for your awesome work!
