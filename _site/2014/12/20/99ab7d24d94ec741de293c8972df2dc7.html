<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I have one silverlight doubt. Can you please share your views on this. (Also solutions if possible. Just give me some references so that I can start immediately)</p>

<p>We wanted to preserve browser cache for our Silverlight app. This is also to reduce loading time of xap in clients browsers. What one of our senior guy told solution is like below.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add the application hostname to content exceptions ( Non-IE Browsers )</li>
  <li>Add the application hostname as Favorite ( IE Browsers )</li>
</ol>

<p>I dont have idea about how to change client machines browsers settings. After some research I found registry change (a .reg file). But still dont know how to write .reg script for that. Is .reg file way is correct way? changing client’s registry?</p>

<p>Are there any other ways.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.
