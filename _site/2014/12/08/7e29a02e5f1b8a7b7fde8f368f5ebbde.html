<p>Hello,
I’ve been following you since the Silverlight days, and am a fan.  I headed a team developing a fairly cutting-edge HTML5-based dashboard app.  We chose to go with the HotTowel-based SPA paradigm, and it has worked out for us fairly well.
But shortly after we made our decision and picked a direction, it looks like you switched allegiance away from KO/Durandal to Angular.  I could not find anywhere where you discuss the reasons for that transition, and was wondering if you could share it with us.
We’re looking to kick off another project, so that info could be quite useful.
Thanks!
