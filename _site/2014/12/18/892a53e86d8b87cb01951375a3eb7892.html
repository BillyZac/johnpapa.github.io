<p>Hi John,
Been following you since your Silverlight days. Quick question/guidance…
We just started porting our businesses SaaS app from Silverlight to angular.js (we’ve been debating which platform to use, angular won). Being an expert on both technologies, any advice on doing this? Would you know of any resources covering this matter that you could point me to?
Any advice would be appreciated.
Regards,
Cliff Strass
