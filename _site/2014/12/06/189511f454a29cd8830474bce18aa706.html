<p>Hello John,</p>

<p>I created a imho really nice module, which greatly simplifies the process of dealing with forms, while giving the programmer the maximum amount of flexibility. The proud father I am, I want as many people as possible being aware of this option, so I was wondering if you might consider to do a little feature about it?</p>

<p>Here comes the repository link: https://github.com/johannesjo/ng-fab-form</p>

<p>I totally understand if you don’t want to, but I thought it might be interesting.</p>

<p>Best Regards,</p>

<p>Johannes
