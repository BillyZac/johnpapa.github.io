<p>John,</p>

<p>We met at the Atlanta Code Camp, in 2013.  I was the guy who drove you to the airport.</p>

<p>I was talking with John Sonmez regarding a recent post of his.  The topic was a mom wanting to get back into the dev biz.  This sparked an idea to do a one-day event, called “Moms who code.”  The idea, based on John’s video, would be to help educate moms:
1) Re-boot their dev skills
2) Direct them to resources to continue learning</p>

<p>I’m still brainstorming this idea, but want to reach out and see if you would like to be part of this idea.</p>

<p>Kindest Regards
