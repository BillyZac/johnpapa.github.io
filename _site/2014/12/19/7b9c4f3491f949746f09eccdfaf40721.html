<p>John,
I have a question hoping you can help me or point me to the right direction.</p>

<p>I am a mid level web developer for a company here in Seattle WA. and I am in the middle of taking your course in PluralSight about Building Apps with Angular and Breeze which is very well explain and easy to follow.</p>

<p>I am developing my first application with Angular following your approach but I have a requirement that I really can’t find a way to do it. I need to allow users to select an excel file and saving the data to the database. I have googled  without any luck all I have found is how to use the  type file control using directives and getting the file name but I need to be able to get the data and send it to the server.</p>

<p>I will really appreciated if you can point me to a working sample if it is not too much to ask.</p>

<p>Thank You ahead of time  and looking forward to hear from you.</p>

<p>Abel Galindo
