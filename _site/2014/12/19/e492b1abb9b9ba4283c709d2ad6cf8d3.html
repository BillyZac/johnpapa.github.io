<p>Hey John, quick question about authentication.  I’ve taken your SPA courses as well as your most recent Angular Clean Code course, which is conspicuously Microsoft-free :).  I’m starting an Angular project which will use WebAPI services, BUT the web app itself will also be packaged into a mobile app (whether it accesses the web site externally or runs it locally is up for grabs).  To do authentication, I like the idea of using OWIN/JWT tokens to give better options in mobile scenarios, if nothing else.  Since this, like anything else in today’s web dev landscape, is still kinda the Wild West, do you know of any templates or seed projects that demonstrate this approach (or another that you prefer)?  As a .NET dev I guess I’ve been spoiled with Forms Auth.  Thanks!
