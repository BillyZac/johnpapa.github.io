<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>Sorry in advance if this seems like a cheap email to write!</p>

<p>So my site is Show Orchard, a showcase for websites powered by Orchard CMS -  only showcasing the best examples out there. I recently redesigned the website in my spare time (I’m a university student in the UK) and I’m driving for more high quality content over the next few months. The hope is to add a lot more ‘featured websites’ with interviews giving a unique and detailed insight into the development of the projects. I’m currently collecting interviews from several large companies and hope to have them up soon.</p>

<p>I was hoping that you could take a look at the site and possibly tweet about it if you feel like it deserves it.</p>

<p>I only ask as I feel like not a lot of people know about the website and it would be great for people to see what the CMS can be used for.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot,
Ryan
