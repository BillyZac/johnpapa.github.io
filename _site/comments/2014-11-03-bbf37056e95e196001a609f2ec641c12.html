<p>Hello John Popa.</p>

<p>I’m following your recent posts about AngularJS and I am very excited about this framework.</p>

<p>Today I have done a project in MVC and would like to convert it to WebAPI + AngularJS + BreezeJS. So I am studying some points where I might run into some trouble, and I’m currently stuck at ease in the MVC offers templates for creating views using Scaffolding.</p>

<p>My question is whether I need to include all fields of my model manually in the view specifying, for example, the type of input for each property (text, date, checkbox …). I also wonder if there is how to create directives that would replace EditorFor Template for eg, add custom masks.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for your time!
