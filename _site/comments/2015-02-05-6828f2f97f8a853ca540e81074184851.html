<p>Hello, John.</p>

<p>I’d like to say thank for sharing the brilliant AngularJS style guide with the community. It really rocks and it considerably simplified my life and sped up the development time.</p>

<p>However, I noticed that the usage of filters is not covered by it.
If possible, could you please advise how to use filters the best way?</p>

<p>I came up with two approaches but not sure if they’re correct.
Here’s a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/nsefjq5c/</p>

<p>I would appreciate greatly if you could take a look at this.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Have a nice day!</p>

<p>Andrey.
