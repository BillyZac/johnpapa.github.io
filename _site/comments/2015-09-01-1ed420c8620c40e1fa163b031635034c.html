<p>“Front-End Tooling with Gulp, Bower, and Yeoman” (Manning Publications) - Book Review</p>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>Slaven with Manning Publications here. We publish computer books for professionals – programmers, system administrators, designers, architects, managers and others.</p>

<p>I wanted to email you and see if you’d be interested in taking a look at our book, Front-End Tooling with Gulp, Bower, and Yeoman written by Stefan Baumgartner (https://manning.com/books/front-end-tooling-with-gulp-bower-and-yeoman).</p>

<p>Front‐End Tooling with Gulp, Bower, and Yeoman teaches you how to use and combine these popular tools to set up a customized development workflow from start to finish. Starting with the big picture of the development process, you’ll see how these tools mesh together. Using patterns and examples, this in-depth book teaches you to use each tool. The second half of the book takes you deeper, showing you how to integrate and extend these tools even more in your development process. By the end of this book, you’ll be skilled at using Gulp, Bower, and Yeoman and combining them to create a powerful, tailored workflow for you and your team.
It’d be great to get some publicity on your Website. Some ideas include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A book review/announcement posted on the blog</li>
  <li>Running a giveaway/contest for the book in conjunction with the review</li>
  <li>Offering an exclusive discount for the book to all your members/readers</li>
  <li>An author interview</li>
  <li>Posting an exclusive excerpt from the book</li>
  <li>Adding a link to the book on the list of resources</li>
</ul>

<p>Would you be open to any of these? Let me know if you’d like to chat about it or if you want me to send the book to you for review as a download link right away.</p>

<p>Best regards,
Slaven</p>
