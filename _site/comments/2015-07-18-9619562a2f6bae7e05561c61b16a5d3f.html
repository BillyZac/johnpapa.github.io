<p>Dear John</p>

<p>I am a Lead Developer at TSYS CardTech Services Ltd, Cyprus (subsidiary of TSYS Inc, USA), an Independent Software Vendor (ISV) where we build credit card management software. At this point, I am writing you on my own initiative and not on behalf of the company to request some information.</p>

<p>We are currently in the beginning of a project to renovate our main UI web application. Our aim to build a SPA platform on which developers will be able to build and deploy “UI components” that will be loosely coupled to enable the composition of tailor made web apps for our customers. This will not be an easy endeavour as is quite different from what we use now which is based on ASP.NET Web Forms.</p>

<p>I have been following your work for some time, especially on SPA, and understand you are one of the experts on the subject. So my enquiry is, do you provide consulting services to companies to help them build the necessary SPA framework and platform? If yes, what kind of services do you provide and do you have an indication of the cost?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance
Michael Panayiotou
