<p>Hello John</p>

<p>First of all thanks for all the posts and videos you provide it’s really got me thinking about my coding! I have a few questions which hopefully you can help me with, though I do realise you’re a busy man so I’m not expecting a swift reply nor a fully detailed explanation! Any suggestions are most welcome and appreciated.</p>

<p>I’m currently trying to broaden my skills even though where I’m currently employed we’re still using webforms. I would like to learn ASP.NET 5 MVC 6 in combination with WEB API, AngularJS (perhaps Breeze as well since I saw a video you did about the combo and it looked really interesting!).</p>

<p>Now where I’m a real sucker is project structure and where to start.. I constantly keep doubting should I do it this way or that way so any insights are welcome. I want to start from a good base to continue learning and provide great code and fluently working apps.</p>

<p>After watching your video I had the idea of per module a folder with the Model (C# class), WebApi Controller, AngularController, Views(they will be more than one page.. think overview , add, edit). My first concern is.. is this a good base or does it sound overkill .. since all I read or hear is SPA.. you must know I hardly know anything about AngularJS.</p>

<p>This is mainly a project to learn but I really want my code to be top notch. I’m already reading books about the SOLID principle and clean code but I want to improve on every level.</p>

<p>I know this message is rather big and thank you so much for taking the time to read it! As stated before any insights are much welcomed and I hope you have a pleasant day. Listening and watching to your seminars are truly helpful!</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>
