<p>Hi John. I watched your plural sight course on how you did a SPA app using sammy, knockout, jquery, etc. and it was awesome.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we are an angufail shop. I have several beefs with angular including, slow performance, it locks you into a set of libraries (for example, we got the angular ui bootstrap version and had to use select2 because it had to be wrapped in a directive), and it is confusing and not intuitive to understand.</p>

<p>My question for you is this? Why is it that people seem so crazy about this framework despite all of its downsides? What benefit would I get using angular vs your approach of picking and choosing libraries as needed? I am not really into the one size fits all approach.</p>

<p>I would just like your thoughts on why you think this is such a great (and according to the people I work with…the GREATEST) framework.</p>

<p>Thanks,
