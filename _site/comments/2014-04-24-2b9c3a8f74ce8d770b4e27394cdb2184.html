<p>I’m curious what you think about the AngularJS changes with Durandal.  IE: Durandal is going away as a viable option.</p>

<p>I’m looking into AngularJS now.  I know it is the thing that everyone is using because it comes from Google but I’m very concerned about the complexity.  I don’t want to build applications that only I can support.  I’m tasked with defining the programming stack for our entire company and I don’t want unnecessary resistance because I chose an overly complex solution.</p>

<p>I want the SPA approach.  What I’m choosing between is using AngularJS or building my own SPA based on HTML5,Knockout, SammyJS, and WebApi.</p>

<p>I’m concerned about getting on board with AngularJS now when they have major changes coming.  I’m trying to find the best path.  I know changes are coming and whatever I promote now will have to change when Angular 2x comes out.  So I need a path that will allow me to work now but migrate without getting killed politically at my company.</p>

<p>Lots of loaded questions.  I gave a lot of info because I wanted you to understand the position I’m in and I’m hoping you can provide some guidance.</p>

<p>Thanks,
Bob Dunaway
