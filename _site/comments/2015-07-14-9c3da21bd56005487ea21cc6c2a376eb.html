<p>I have been using your Angularjs style guide to pattern my own applications and it has been so helpful to me.  There is one thing I was curious about that I have not been able to find on the net anywhere that I was hoping you could answer for me.  I have been using services to store and handle any data that I receive via ajax calls.  These services might also be called upon to handle any kind of data manipulation with these objects.  Because of that, I have been binding to the getter function of an object.  For example, assuming I have mapped a variable in the controller to the getter function of a service for an object, I do the following:
ng-model=”ctrl.myObj()”
This way I never have to worry about the data in the controller and any changes made via this binding will automatically update the object via the service’s getter function for that object.<br />
My question to you, is there any disadvantage to modeling this way and, with the exception of calling a couple extra lines of code every cycle, will it effect performance?
