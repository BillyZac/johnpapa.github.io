<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I am long time fan of your articles and tweets.</p>

<p>I recently listened to you on the Hello World podcast and found the interview to be fascinating and informative.</p>

<p>I was very intrigued in your efforts to increase the quality of code in your teams as part of your day job,</p>

<p>I was wondering if you have published any info around this area, I did poke about on your blog but didn’t find anything related to increasing code quality.</p>

<p>I have been in the process of attempting to increase the quality of our code and coders, and any resources you can suggest or recommend would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks for all the great post and tweets and keep up the good work,</p>

<p>Regards</p>

<p>Ian Mechanic
