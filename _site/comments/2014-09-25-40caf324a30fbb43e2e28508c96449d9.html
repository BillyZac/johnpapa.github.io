<p>Dear John,</p>

<p>I’m a situation apparently without solution and I address to you and your experience in search for an exit.</p>

<p>What I’m stuck on it is concerning the unwrapping of promises in the code in order to retain the XHR-ed JSON object. I need it to be loaded in a factory property to be made easily available to the controller in the end.</p>

<p>Is this thing possible? And if yes, please show me a path into solving this riddle. Some details here as well: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25544620/angularjs-return-data-from-the-promise-in-controllers-scope</p>

<p>In the end I need the clean JSON in the singleton the factory produces.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time.
