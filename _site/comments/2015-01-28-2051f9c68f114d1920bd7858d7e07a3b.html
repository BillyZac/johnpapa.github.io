<p>Hey John:</p>

<p>I have followed your work for awhile and would love to have you come and speak in Kansas City. I run the Kansas City Developer Conference (KCDC). This year’s conference is June 24th, 25th, 26th. The 24th is an optional “precompiler” day with full and half-day, hands-on courses and the main conference is the 25th and 26th. I can cover hotel and air-fare for you to come out if you’d be interested.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your consideration.</p>

<p>Lee Brandt
Director, KCDC
