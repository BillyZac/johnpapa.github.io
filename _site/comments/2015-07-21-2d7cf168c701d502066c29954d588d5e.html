<p>Hello!</p>

<p>Really enjoying the Hottowel-gererator you developed!</p>

<p>I am an OSX user but have have been following along your tutorials on PluralSight for a few tips regarding the hottowel spa. I have noticed some significant differences between your exercise files and my hottowel-generator files. This is fine, as I have been able to dig around and figure out what has been renamed and/or re-organized.</p>

<p>However, I am running into an issue with the show/hide buttons not displaying. 
I would really like to have the ability to minimize widgets with a single click. In fact I can see the code for the allowCollapse, but the buttons do not display when running the app locally. Something seems to be messed up. A freshly generated hottowel app doesnt show the buttons at all when loaded in the browser. Are you aware of this issue? Any idea what might be causing it or how to fix it? Thanks very much for your time and consideration! Great repo!
