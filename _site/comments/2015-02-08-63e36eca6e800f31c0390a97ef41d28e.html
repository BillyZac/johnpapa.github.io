<p>Hi John</p>

<p>I followed your cource on pluralsight in the course Angular and breeze.
It is a cool solution.</p>

<p>I want to do the steps on my own site and used the hottowel with typescript template (with all current updates from nuget)</p>

<p>Currently I’ve  the  problem, that the controller is not bounded to the view. The init code for the controller is running and the toastr message is visible.
the Problem is the binding. could you give me a hint?</p>

<p>Kind regards
Stefan
