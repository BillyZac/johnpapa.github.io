<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>first of all: nice styleguide!</p>

<p>And now a question regarding https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide#style-y125</p>

<p>==
function customersService() { }
==</p>

<p>Why not writing UpperCamelCase (like a controller). As far as I understood, the service also gets instantiated with ‘new’ (by AngularJS). Means: this is a constructor function (where you also can use the ‘this’ keyword), right?</p>

<p>Or maybe I’m just confusing things…</p>

<p>Thanks and regards from Germany, 
Mario
