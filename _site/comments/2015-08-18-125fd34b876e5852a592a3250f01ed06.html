<p>John,</p>

<p>I recently started a podcast where I interview successful software professionals and find stories and ideas about programming and life in software.</p>

<p>I’d really love to feature you as a guest on the show and hear your perspective and share your story.  If you’d be interested in spending 45 minutes or so with me, I think we’d have a result that would benefit my listeners and hopefully be rewarding for you as well.</p>

<p>The site for the show is here:
http://developeronfire.com/</p>

<p>Here is my blog post describing what I am trying to do with the podcast:

<p>Please let me know if you think this is something you’d find worthwhile and would be willing to talk with me.
