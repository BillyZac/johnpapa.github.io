<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I just finished your Pluralsight course on Typescript and I’ve also completed your courses on AngularJS.  Super helpful!  You are definitely a great teacher.</p>

<p>I was wondering if you had an opinion or any deep experience using both typescript and angular together in a decent sized project?  I’d be interested in someone’s perspective who has actually done a real world project using both together.</p>

<p>Thanks again, and keep up the good work!</p>

<p>-Chris
