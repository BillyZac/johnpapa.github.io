<p>Hi John</p>

<p>Thanks in no small part to your Pluralsight courses we managed to go live with a new product back in September 2013 with support for multiple devices and screen sizes, the ability to package as a mobile app, some offline support and various other important architectural level requirements we wanted to achieve. We also wanted to keep our dev time in line with what we managed with our previous server side website efforts and avoid a steep javascript learning curve which we managed to some degree.</p>

<p>We’ve written our framework in typescript and more importantly the developers implement their modules in html and a well defined typescript class which provides method stubs at all the important module lifecycle points. We built a client side type generator so the developers have a type safe, intellisense rich representation of our server side controllers.</p>

<p>I think we’ve put together something pretty cool, albeit with technologies that were hot in 2013 (knockout versus angular) and I am thankful for your help in that journey.</p>

<p>If you ever had time for a short skype / google hangout session I’d love to show you some of our work. I’ll certainly be diving into your Angular work before kicking off future projects.</p>

<p>all the best from South Africa</p>
