<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I’m Enrico, co-founder of Wami. 
Let me introduce myself and my company - I’ll be quick, I promise.</p>

<p>Wami is a tech startup working in the travel industry with mobile travel guides (to know more about us: www.wami.it).</p>

<p>The maps we use inside our applications are built from OSM data: they’re super cool vectorial maps that are among the lightest ones on the market and can be used offline, as well.</p>

<p>But we didn’t stop here: while we were working on Open Street Map data, we’ve created awesome data sets featuring reworked and optimized data in JSON and geoJSON format.</p>

<p>… which brings us to the point of my e-mail: we’ve recently released a project called Wami Map http://map.wami.it - now our APIs are open to all developers wishing to create geolocalized application in a fast and easy way.</p>

<p>Why don’t you take a look and let me know your opinion about it? I do believe we can give life to amazing projects, so fork us on GitHub and help Wami Map grow and improve!</p>

<p>For further enquires, let’s keep in touch.</p>
