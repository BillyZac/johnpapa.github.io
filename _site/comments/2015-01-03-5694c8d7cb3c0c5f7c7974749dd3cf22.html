<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>FYI, you have offensive comment posted a couple of days ago on “5 Simple Steps to Commanding in Silverlight”. It is showing up on your home page under recent comments. Don’t know what is wrong with some people.</p>

<p>Anyway, since I’m here; thank you so much for all the work you do, I have been a big fan of yours back to the silverlight days and have used countless amounts of training material you have produced. Excellent job, you are very inspiring. Keep up the awesomeness man :)</p>
