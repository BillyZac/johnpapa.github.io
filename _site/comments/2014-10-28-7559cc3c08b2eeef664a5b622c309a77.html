<p>Hello John,</p>

<p>I’ve been following your blog and Twitter feed for some time now, and I felt the need to reach out to you and humbly ask if I could glean some insight on how to be successful in the web development industry?</p>

<p>First, let me give you a little background on myself. I’m 37 years old and I’ve been enlisted in the US Air Force since 1995. I’m a year or two away from retirement and I’m excited about making the transition from military to civilian life. I’ve had a knack and passion for programming since my parents brought home our first IBM PC when I was 11 years old. I’ve taught myself a plethora of languages, from BASIC to C#, and it’s only been recently within the past 4 years that I eventually earned some actual web programming experience. I learned a lot, starting with ASP.NET MVC and then branching into the client-side frameworks Durandal, Kendo UI, and Angular. Surprisingly, such experience is not common in the military, unless programming in ancient languages like JOVIAL is your goal. I have a Bachelor’s Degree in IT with a software engineering focus, and I’m vacillating between pursuing graduate school or industry certifications.</p>

<p>Anyway, given my experience and the time I have left in the military, I’d like to pick your brain and see what advice you may have. In your opinion, how does one best set themselves up for success in the web development industry? What are the best ways to improve one’s self and be marketable to future employers? Why are you successful?</p>

<p>Thank you for your time John. I enjoy reading your blog posts and tweets, and learning from you on Pluralsight. I have put a lot of your advice and lessons to good use. Keep doing what you’re doing!</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Brett Fincher, MSgt, USAF
