<p>Hey John,</p>

<p>I know you probably get swamped with e-mails, but wanted to reach out to you with a question about your application module tips (already watched the majority of your new PluralSight video - fantastic job). This is related to the “core” module concept.</p>

<p>When you have modules that depend on using another module’s “Provider” in a config block - does this strategy break down a little? I think your demonstration touched on this very briefly, when you shifted your blocks modules around a bit, and you quickly explained it wouldn’t work because of some config requirements.</p>

<p>For instance, if you have features in separate modules, and those features each register their routes in config blocks via the $routeProvider - don’t those routes both have to define a module dependency on ‘ngRoute’ (directly or indirectly)?</p>

<p>I have a Plunkr of the simplest scenario of this demonstration:</p>

<p>http://plnkr.co/edit/aHOpWDzNp0cowaCvzXuB</p>

<p>My question is - it seems that the application is consistently running OK if ‘core’ is the first dependency declared… for safety, would you recommend explicitly defining ‘core’ as a module dependency for the two feature modules?</p>

<p>Sorry for the long-winded email.</p>

<p>Thanks again for all of the information you’ve shared, you’ve made me a better developer and your contributions to the community are greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks,
Andre Giannico
