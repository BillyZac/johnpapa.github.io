<p>Dear Mr. Papa,</p>

<p>I am really like the SPA. I wish that I could build one SPA application like what you did. I found one course that you provided in Pluralsight might be a good start. The course called “Single Page Apps with HTML5, Web API, Knockout and jQuery” and got stucked. I am hoping to get some helps from you.</p>

<p>The step that I am currently stucked at is that after I have built all the backend data/repository/uow layers, all were tested it and worked beatifully. but when I was trying to view the Json data through the api url like:  ./api/sessions. I first got this:  ‘… self references’ error which then later I found the solution by putting the config.Formatters.JsonFormatter.SerializerSettings.ReferenceLoopHandling = Newtonsoft.Json.ReferenceLoopHandling.Ignore;  in the WebApiConfig.cs file. but now I consistantly got ‘Insufficient memory to continue the execution of the program.’ error when trying to access the Json data through the api URL. even when I only tried to view one record out of the database through ..api/sessions/5.. Any input/directions would be very helpful and much appreciated. Thanks a lot!!</p>

<p>PS:  The only difference between the CodeCamper sample project and mine is that I am using database first EF approaches instead of code first EF. So all the model poco classes are generated.</p>

<p>Best regards,
Jennifer
