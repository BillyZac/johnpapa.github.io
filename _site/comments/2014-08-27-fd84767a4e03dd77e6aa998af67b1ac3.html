<p>Hi,</p>

<p>We were hoping your audience might be interested in hearing about the latest hot trend in web application development. MEAN is an opinionated fullstack javascript framework which simplifies and accelerates web application development(MongoDb, Express, AngularJs and Node.js). Google has just added Mean.io to their cloud platform - “click to deploy” program (alongside open-source giants like Cassandra, MongoDB, and RabbitMQ).</p>

<p>Mean.io is an year old open source project that gives web developers a really delightful web application development experience, which is purely based on JavaScript and is the first web technology to be picked by Google. We also have doubled our traction from 400 to over 800 downloads a day over the past 3 months!</p>

<p>Here’s the link to official Google announcement: http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.co.il/2014/08/click-to-deploy-mean-development-stack-on-google-compute-engine.html</p>

<p>And here’s the link to Google’s click to deploy the program
https://developers.google.com/cloud/mean/click-to-deploy</p>

<p>Official Site’s Link: http://mean.io/
Kindly acknowledge, if you found our work informative and interesting.</p>

<p>With Best Regards,
Melissa
