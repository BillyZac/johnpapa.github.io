<p>Hi John.</p>

<p>I love your courses and think you’re doing wonderful job.</p>

<p>I have a tiny question regarding your SPA course with Durandal and Breeze:
How do you get this excellent intellisense on the client side?
Does Resharper envolved?
Is it some NuGet package(s)?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,
Shachar.
