<p>Hey John,</p>

<p>I was great meeting you at the Author’s Summit. Thanks for your thoughts on ‘live action’ agile retrospective course at lunch on Friday. On another note, you mentioned that Disney is looking for some .NET folks. I searched the Disney Careers site but there are tons of jobs on the site. Can you point me in the right direction for the jobs you mentioned?</p>

<p>Thanks!
