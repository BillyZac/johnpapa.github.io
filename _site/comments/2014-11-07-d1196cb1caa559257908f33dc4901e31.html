<p>Aloha John Papa!</p>

<p>My son did a two week Sea Turtle Camp expedition to Hawaii last summer. This year he says he’d like to go down and work/volunteer at Disney World in Florida for a summer adventure.</p>

<p>He’s 16 (but will be 17 in February), is an Eagle Scout and is advanced open water dive certified (in case they need help cleaning the tanks in Epcot ;?)</p>

<p>Any advice on where he might find an interesting mini-internship down in your neck of the woods?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
