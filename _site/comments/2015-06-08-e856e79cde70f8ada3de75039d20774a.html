<p>Hey John,</p>

<p>Hope you are well. I would love your advice when you have some time.</p>

<p>Quick background.</p>

<p>I have no experience in programming. Had a rough year last year, decided to switch professions and decided I am going to learn programming and master it by working hard at it.</p>

<p>But its been difficult. It took me time but I finally settled on JS (over Python) and then after a lot of back and forth, I settled on the MEAN stack (over Meteor).</p>

<p>I am planning to take Pluralsight courses but I feel so lost. I studied basic JS and am trying to follow application examples to learn from books.</p>

<p>If you have any advice, I would love it if you would share. Also, do you think MEAN is a good way to get going? I am thinking about focusing on Angular and Sails but not sure.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Jay
