<p>John,</p>

<p>Happy fathers’ day!</p>

<p>I have just launched my podcast, Developer On Fire, focused on stories of delivering value from successful developers.  I think you would be perfect for an interview to share some of your experience.  Would you be interested in spending 45 minutes with me on a Skype call to do an interview and share your story?  My blog post about what I’m trying to do is at http://optimizedprogrammer.com/blog/my-podcast-is-live and you can find my feed and more information on the developeronfire.com site.</p>

<p>Looking forward to hearing from you,
Dave Rael
