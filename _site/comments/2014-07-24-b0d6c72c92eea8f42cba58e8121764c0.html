<p>Using the Hot Towel SPA Concepts for a SPA using AngularJs… What is the best way to fire an event after the new view has been loaded. $scope.$watch(‘$viewContentLoaded’) fires before the content for the view has been loaded.  Setting a timeout after the activate method works but this doesn’t seem like the best approach to handle this.  Any direction would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks,
