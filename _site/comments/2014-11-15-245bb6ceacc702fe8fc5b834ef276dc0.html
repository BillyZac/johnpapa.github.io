<p>Hello! John,
I am Anup from Bangalore, India, I am a cofounder at Leverage (www.leverageit.in), we are a team of 10 people Asp.net programers. We just started on our journey on Windows Universal App on Javascript, with a porting project and we are teribly struck! Hence I am writing to you to find out if you can help us get unstruck with a couple of hours of your expert consuting time.</p>

<p>Background:
We got the Windows store app 8.0 from our customer and we ported it to Windows Store app 8.1. After that we started porting this app to Windows Universal App. 
We converted all the C# libraries to portable C# libraries, so that we can use it for Win Phone 8.1 and Win 8.1;</p>

<p>Issue:
We are facing an issue after we ported the SQLite related code to a SQLite Portable class library.</p>

<p>I know your will be hardpressed for time, but making an attempt to reach you! - will you be able to help us by looking at our code - on Gotomeeting or Teamviewer? If so, please do let me know when you will be able to look at it and your fees. If you cannot take this on, is it possible to suggest an expert for this job from your network.</p>

<p>Thank You in advance, 
Anup
