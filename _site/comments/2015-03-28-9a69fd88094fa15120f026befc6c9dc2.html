<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I really like your Angular styleguide. I’m going to use it to give my development team some guidelines for coding in the UI (they are not really in to web development).</p>

<p>But I have a question. How do you see best practices for AngularJS + Browserify? For instance on attaching  controllers to modules, loading modules into your main app etc.
