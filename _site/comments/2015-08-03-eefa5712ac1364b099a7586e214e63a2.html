<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I read and watch your work around VS Code.
Right now I am using this tool mostly for git file compare, and I find it very, very useful. 
Only one thing missing: I can’t find how to set (or maybe it’s already exist) keyboard shortcut for “Next Change” and “Previous Change”…</p>

<p>I don’t know is this right place to ask, but can you help me with this?</p>

<p>Thanks &amp; Regards,
Sasa
