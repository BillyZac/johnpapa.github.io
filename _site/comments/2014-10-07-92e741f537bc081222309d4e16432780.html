<p>Hey John,</p>

<p>I was just going through your github repos and found one typo ‘proposal.yaml’ file @ https://github.com/johnpapa/submissions-2015/blob/master/awesome-build-pipeline-with-gulp/proposal.yaml</p>

<p>Under you bio, you have mentioned that “AngularJS Style Guide on github has over 82800 stars”. I believe you wanted to say 2800 instead? Star count as I write this mail is 2925. Good luck</p>
