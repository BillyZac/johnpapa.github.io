<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>i have a simple question for you regarding spa applications.. Im an entreprise architect, two years ago we decided to move our in-house application to spa application. We have this “big” application, with around 400 crud functions, 60 reports, and we having some performance issue… So i was wondering if Spa application is a model for all kind of application?</p>

<p>Thank you
