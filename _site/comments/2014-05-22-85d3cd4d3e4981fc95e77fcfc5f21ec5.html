<p>Hello John,</p>

<p>My name is Rody Zakovich with PATLive. We are software communications company out of Tallahassee, FL.</p>

<p>We recently sponsored a MeetUp with Rob Eisenberg, in which he discussed the benefits of using Durandal and what’s next to come with Angular 2.0.</p>

<p>Tallahassee is, to say the least, .NET dependent. We are trying to sponsor events and bring speakers in who can at least show the benefits of using JavaScript to create SPAs.</p>

<p>I believe your efforts to bring these worlds together is phenomenal. I know that you are a busy individual, but if possible, we would like more than anything for you to be a guest speaker for a MeetUp event.</p>

<p>I know that we will have a great turn out, and hopefully you can convince some of local software companies to start looking towards the future of development.</p>

<p>Please feel free to contact me at anytime.</p>

<p>Thank you again John,
Rody Zakovich
