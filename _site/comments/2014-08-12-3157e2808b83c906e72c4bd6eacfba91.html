<p>Hey John,</p>

<p>Love your blog.</p>

<p>I have a question on Breeze.js…</p>

<p>What situations does Breeze not work well with?</p>

<p>I’ve used it on a relatively simple AngularJS CRUD app and it worked great for me. I have been pushing it around the office but I figured I should understand the bad with the good.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Can’t wait for the AngularJS Best Practices Pluralsight course
