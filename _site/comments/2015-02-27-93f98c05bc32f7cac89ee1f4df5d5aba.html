<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I am beginning a little late to the game with AngularJS, also trying to take on learning how the many other JS libraries can be used to make awesome things in Angular.</p>

<p>I’ve used your SPA and breeze application from your website tutorial/Pluralsight class and that has really helped me understand a lot in the beginning. Thank you for putting those resources together.</p>

<p>I was hoping you knew of what conferences that would be beneficial for a starting web developer to attend. I am located in the U.S. West, so anything in SF, Las Vegas, AZ, etc is very easy for me to get to - but if it’s worth attending, no matter its location, I’d like to know about it to make arrangements to attend.</p>

<p>Thanks for your time,</p>

<p>Matthew Scott
