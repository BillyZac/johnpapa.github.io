<p>Hello John , 
i am from india, recently i have watched pluralsight course Building spa app with hot towel angular &amp; breeze. I can’t tell you how good it was. I want to appreciate you. You really done awesome work. By learning through your courses you make my work easy. 
But now i am in trouble again for security concern. i want to implement token based authentication on web api (.net) and on client side breeze. But for that i am not getting any help. If it possible can you please help me with any articles or videos. 
thanks
Sarang Chawla
