<p>The AngularJS style guide is really excellent, thanks for posting that. I found that when I use the IIFE syntax, as recommended, I suddenly get the error -Argument XYZCtrl is not a function, got undefined- and it does not find the controller. I wrapped all elements in each JS file (app.js, controller.js, etc.)  in the IIFE syntax, I must be missing something? Thanks, Bert
