<p>Dear Mr. Papa,</p>

<p>First of all, many thanks for your great blog! Sharing the experience is something that drives the world further!</p>

<p>I’ve got a question and I would like to hear your opinion on the matter.</p>

<p>Imagine we have a controller for the list of items. Controller get’s data from some source (for example, route’s <code>resolve</code> section). I implemented a service that manipulates (filter, cache, updates, etc.) the data for the controller. The question is where should I store the data? Is it architecturally correct to store it in the service right after the controller has beed initialised and clean up the service in <code>$on('destroy')</code> callback? Or should I store the data in the $scope, for example, and call the service for only dirty job (in this case service becomes a helper)?</p>

<p>From my opinion, the second variant doesn’t allow to share the data among other controller (to see the item’s details or edit item). However, my colleague’s argue is that service should be stateless, something like $http. I am still thinking that Angular way of sharing data among controllers is to implement a service, which holds the data, populate it while controller is starting and release it when scope is being destroyed. What do you think on this matter?</p>

<p>Sincerely yours,
Ivan Demchenko</p>

<p>P.S. I am sorry for my English, it is my second language :)
