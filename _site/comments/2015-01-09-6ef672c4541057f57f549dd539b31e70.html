<p>John,</p>

<p>I’m watching your PluralSight course “Building Apps with Angular and Breeze” and implementing it into a new intranet application. The course is really great and I’m really beginning to like AngularJS.</p>

<p>I’ve searched extensively and have not found any basic examples or even concepts as to how to utilize Windows Authentication with an Angular app. My web.config is set up as usual, but it is not immediately apparent to me how to implement an intranet web site using Windows Auth with Angular.</p>

<p>Any help or direction would be appreciated. Thank you.</p>
