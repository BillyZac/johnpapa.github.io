<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I’m following your “Building Apps with Angular and Breeze” course on PluralSight. I created the project, added the existing projects and installed HotTowel. My project builds successfully but when I run it, all I see in the page is: “”. Do you have any idea why this could happen? My guess is that the HotTowel pre-release version was different that the stable version!?</p>

<p>I would really appreciate your answer and I can’t thank you enough for all the great courses that you have online. I’ve learned a lot from you both online and in South Florida Code Camp.</p>

<p>Regards,
Alina
