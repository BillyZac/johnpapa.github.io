<p>Hi John</p>

<p>Thanks for your great style guide. I just wanted to share one observation regarding the controllerAs syntax in conjunction with a $watcher. I found that</p>

<p>$scope.$watch( ‘vm.myVar’, function .. etc</p>

<p>didnt work. What I needed was:</p>

<p>$scope.$watch( function(){ return vm.myVar; }, function .., etc</p>

<p>And furthermore, if I were watching a variable on an injected service, and had referenced the service as a local variable, I needed this:</p>

<p>vm.myService  = MyService;
$scope.$watch( function(){ return vm.getValue() ), function(){ /* do stuff */ });</p>

<p>vm.getValue = function(){ return vm.myService.getValue() };</p>

<p>Though the watcher worked if I referenced MyService directly.</p>

<p>Anyway, just offering it as a possible amendment to your excellent suggestions.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Doug
