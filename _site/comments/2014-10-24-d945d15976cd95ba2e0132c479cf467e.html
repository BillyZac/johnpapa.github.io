<p>Dear John,</p>

<p>I imagine you are very busy. If you find a min to answer me shortly i’l appreciate as i’m really confused. If there is anything i can do to help let me know!</p>

<p>I want to learn either javascript or angular or jquery etc..</p>

<p>Jquery is a library, angular “framework”. Jumping to jquery for ex. is fine but im confused as to the difference between jquery and angular as far as learning?</p>

<p>As nonsense as it might be i want to start with either a library or framework. I’l start with a shortcut.</p>

<p>As a very experienced developer as you are, what would you say is the best pick to start? From all the different flavours out there, as, Breeze etc etc</p>

<p>Cheers!
Pedro
