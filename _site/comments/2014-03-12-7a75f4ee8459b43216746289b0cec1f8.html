<p>I’m going through your PluralSight Angular Breeze Code Camper.
I’m a bit stuck because of this statement on the Breeze website:</p>

<p>The to$q has been deprecated. It is superseded by the Breeze Angular Service.</p>

<p>I am trying to work through using the Breeze Angular Service but would appreciate a little help in understanding how.</p>

<p>I was at both of your presentations on AngularJS at South Florida Code Camp!</p>

<p>Thanks,
Murph
