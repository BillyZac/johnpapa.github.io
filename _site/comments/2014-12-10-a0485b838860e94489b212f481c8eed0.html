<p>Hey John, I’m still trying to get up to speed on angular. I’ve gone through the pluralsight  videos, read “most” of the angular pro book and I think I have a pretty good idea of the framework and how to implement it in a production product. Which by the way is what I am currently trying to do. One question that I had was we work with a secure web app that uses the thinktecture identity framework. Using ASP.NET MVC I have easy access to the claim issued by the sts to pull off whatever info I need. However if I wanted to bypass the MVC controller and only use an angular service to talk to my web api how do I go about doing this? I’ve seen some suggestions on Stack for this my injecting into a JS variable the claim using Razor, but this seems unsecure, and I don’t want to get into ciphering a bunch of objects if I don’t need to. I really don’t want to injecting the claim into the current page as there are a number of issues I have with this from an implementation standpoint that would cause the product to fail over time (expiration of the claim etc).</p>

<p>If you could point me to any resources or suggestions on how I should retrieve and read a claim issued from an STS only using Angular / or just plain JS I would greatly appreciate it.</p>

<p>I know you’re swamped with emails, but thanks in advance for any insight.</p>

<p>Best Regards,</p>
