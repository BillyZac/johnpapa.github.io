<p>John,
I’m a huge fan of your talks, books, casts, etc.  I listen to Adventures in Angular religiously.</p>

<p>As a developer playing CIO for a diabetic retinopathy screening company (http://www.retinalscreenings.com), I, and my team, have embraced both angular and typescript.  We’ve jumped in heads first and I’m sure we’re making massive mistakes while doing some good stuff!</p>

<p>We have some VERY interesting technology in the background that, by using machine learning and image parsing, can tell a patient if they have issues that need to be seen by a physician rather quickly.  Its completely automated and can give a result to a patient in less than 2 mins.</p>

<p>We are based in Pensacola, FL and have customers all over the place.  Right now, we are in development of 2.0 of our system, and our backend is absolutely amazing…where we lack is front end amazing-ness.</p>

<p>I don’t know if you do this, but I would love to talk to you about maybe coming to Pensacola for a few days, and teaching us some of your best practices around angular and typescript.  We use your style guide as our bible for angular apps, but need real help pushing the envelope on the tie between angular and typescript.</p>

<p>If this is something you think might be fun/interesting, please let me know, because it would be our pleasure to host you in Pensacola for a day or two.</p>

<p>Looking forward to hearing from you and I hope you have an awesome day!</p>

<p>Thanks,
Jonathan
