<p>Thanks for sharing your knowledge on pluralsight.  I enjoy learning from your videos.  I noticed a small bug on your http://cc-ng-z.azurewebsites.net/#/ site and I figured I’d give you a heads up.  It’s nothing huge but here is how you can recreate it.  Minimize the site enough to get to the point where the menu button shows up.  Press the menu button to open  and close the menu.  Leave the menu in its closed state.  Then maximize the window.  The left side menu remains in its hidden state with no menu button available to reopen it.
