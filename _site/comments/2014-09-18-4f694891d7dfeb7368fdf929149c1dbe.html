<p>I am a relative newbie.  I am enjoying your Hottowel template.  I am coming up to speed on the Typescript template.  I am having some trouble using ngGrid with Hottowel, and getting data to populate.</p>

<p>Can you direct me to a sample that I can follow?</p>

<p>Thanks again for the cool template.  It is helping me out a lot.
