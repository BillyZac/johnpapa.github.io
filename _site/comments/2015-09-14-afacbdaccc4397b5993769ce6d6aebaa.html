<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I’m a news editor for Softpedia.com and I’m interested in writing an article about your “AngularJS Style Guide as a Poster” project. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1CCs2-ipu0Uz547FAeucsVlBIsJY8ZgG7rnecvbWJOXQ/viewform</p>

<p>I have a few questions if you could be so kind to answer when you have time.</p>

<p>First, is this project still going to happen or have I stumbled across something really ancient?</p>

<p>Second, if it’s still going on, when is the deadline, when you close the poll and create the poster?</p>

<p>Third, do you intend to later allow users to mix and match their favorite sections and create their own posters, or you’ll provide one single variant?</p>

<p>Thank you in advance,
Catalin
