<p>Hi Papa,</p>

<p>Thank you for your help I used to use the hottowel with knockout, but when I used the angular one i noticed you did not use the requireJs, can I know why because in huge project I cant add all the controllers in the index page as what you did in the sample of hottowel angular.</p>

<p>Thanks and Regards
Omar
