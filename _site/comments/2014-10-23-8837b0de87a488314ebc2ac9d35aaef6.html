<p>Hello John,</p>

<p>I’m new to AngularJS and been watching your new course AngularJS Patterns: Clean Code on Pluralsight and have been really enjoying the information your sharing.  My background is in .NET and I’m trying my first app in AngularJS and using Microsoft’s Webapi to communicate with my domain.  My confusion comes into play with providing a public site where users will register and log in.  My site resides in Azure and wanted to find out what the best practice is using AngularJS in securing my site?</p>

<p>In the research I have done so far it looks like people are using json web tokens and storing the token in the session storage and then passing that in the header via rest calls.</p>

<p>Thanks for your time and any suggestions.</p>
