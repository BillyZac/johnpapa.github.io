<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>My name is Sunitha Palanna and I work for Packt Publishing, a U.K. based publishing firm specializing in focused IT books.</p>

<p>Packt has recently published a new title “Learning AngularJS for .NET Developers”. This book covers all of the stages of building a single-page web application, starting with frontend components powered by AngularJS, continuing with web services that leverage ServiceStack, and putting it all together in an ASP.NET MVC application. You can find the book here: http://bit.ly/1pBOkQm</p>

<p>I came across your Blog via a Google search and I’m aware that you share good knowledge in the subject this book covers. We are currently looking for reviewers who would be willing to review the book and provide their honest thoughts about the book on Blogs/Websites/Amazon/Goodreads. Considering your knowledge and experience in this subject, I feel you would make an excellent reviewer of this book.</p>

<p>In case this subject interests you and you’d like to go through the book, I’ll be happy to provide you with an eBook copy.</p>

<p>I look forward to hear from you.</p>

<p>Regards,
Sunitha
