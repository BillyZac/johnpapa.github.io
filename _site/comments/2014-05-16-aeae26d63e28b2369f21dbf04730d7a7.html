<p>Hello!</p>

<p>I’m not sure how to start, so I’ll try to keep this short and to the point.  :)</p>

<p>Many of the developers here love your contributions to the web community.  As such, we were hoping that you might be able to help us out.</p>

<p>We’re trying to make a case to the higher ups to allow us to use Angular in some of our new applications.  We’ve written a medium-sized proof-of-concept where we took one of our more complicated components and rewrote it using Angular/Breeze/EF – we saw a 90% savings in the number of lines of code and were able to accomplish this in a matter of hours.  Though our boss’s bosses were slightly impressed, they want more concrete numbers on a much larger scale.</p>

<p>We were hoping that you might have some knowledge of this…  What we’re looking for is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Have you worked on an application where Angular was used and what was the time savings on it compared to that same application using ASP.NET MVC or ASP.NET Web Forms).</li>
  <li>On that same application, what was the savings in the amount of code that was written?  Is there a metric available for maintenance cost savings because of the smaller code base?</li>
</ol>

<p>We need to provide as concrete numbers as possible from real businesses that have switched to Angular/Breeze/EF.</p>

<p>If there’s anything at all you could do to help us here, we’d greatly appreciate it.</p>

<p>Thank you so much!
