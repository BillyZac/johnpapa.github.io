<p>Hello John,</p>

<p>I am the organizer of the Google Developer Group (GDG) Central FL. I have also probably shared some emails with you at Disney (I work for Capgemini as part of Solution Engineering).</p>

<p>I am interested to know if you have signed up as a Google Developer Expert already. It will be great to see you featured in this link:
https://developers.google.com/experts/americas/technology/angular-js</p>

<p>If you have not done already, would you mind, if we nominate you as part of the GDG? Will be proud to have you as a GDE in our local area.</p>

<p>Thanks,
Siva G
