<p>John, HotTowel is terrific!  Thanks for all your efforts!</p>

<p>Seeking tips or advice on best structure of login/logout navigation structure for HotTowel.  When a user would click a logout button, can’t just switch to a routed view because the topnav menu bar is cached and still displays.  Would you recommend a separate module, or a redirect back through index.html with passed parameter to determine whether to show the standard shell.html or hide its contents and instead show just a login page (thereby reloading the whole module but hiding topnav, sidebar, etc.)?
While aspects of all this are somewhat standard, it is also tricky to set it up in a completely new framework (and not something we do very often as it is just one-time setup per application - and last time I did all this was in Silverlight over five years ago!!!).  Any advice or tips would be awesome.  I am trying to set this up in .NET and want to drive it all using Identity, and just getting familiar with how to make the various layers “talk” and finding the “best’ method for doing so is a little trickier than it sounds on the surface.  Thanks!
