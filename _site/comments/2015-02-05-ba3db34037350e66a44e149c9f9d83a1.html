<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I’m a Sr developer working for Nordea, the major bank in the Scandinavian area. We have an internal network for all the Java developers within the bank (&gt;200), where I’m the driver for the guys working in Norway. The network also includes our colleagues in Denmark, Norway and Finland.</p>

<p>From time to time the network arranges sessions (~2. hrs) on some current topic, often with well-known national and international speakers. We have had couple of speakers from thought works, Typesafe , kodemaker and many more. I know that you are a very enthusiastic speaker and contributor in  IT .I read about  10 AngularJS Patterns course and article. We would be happy to hear something from you. For e.g.: Using angular js effectively , angularjs pattern clean code.</p>

<p>We are group of senior and junior developers who have worked a lot with java. Some of us are also using scala , angular js.</p>

<p>So, does this sound interesting to you? And if so, when would be a good time for you to speak for e.g. in Oslo?
 All work and travel will of course be compensated. However the network’s budget is quite limited, so we will have to know something about your rates as well :-). We can also do this as a Online Webinar.</p>

<p>Hope to hear from you.</p>

<p>Best regards,
Amruta Sonandkar
