<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>Recently I’ve bought one of your old book “Professional ADO 2.5 RDS Programming with ASP 3.0”.published through Wrox books.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the Wrox website no more contains the source code for the examples explained in the book.</p>

<p>I googled and found this page. I’m wondering if you still have the source code and I can request a copy. If available, can you please zip and email to nadeem.email@yahoo.com..</p>

<p>Your help will be highly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks and Regards,
Nadeem Khan
