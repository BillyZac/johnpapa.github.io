<p>John,</p>

<p>Thank you for all you have done in providing content and code for helping folks get better at what they do.  Thanks also for your inspiration in becoming a focal point for helping developers with great content and, in part, inspiring me to blog and now podcast.</p>

<p>I have recently launched a podcast with interviews with successful software people where I focus on stories and learning about the developers and how they deliver value.  It would be great if I could get you to share 45ish minutes with me to do an interview for the show.</p>

<p>To find out more about what I’m doing, here is my blog post about the podcast:

<p>and here is the site:

<p>Please let me know if you’d be interested.</p>

<p>Thanks,
Dave Rael
