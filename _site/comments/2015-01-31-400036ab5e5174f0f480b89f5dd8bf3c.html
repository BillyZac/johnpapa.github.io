<p>Hi John;</p>

<p>I’ve gone through many of your Pluralsight courses on my way to learn about SPA. I really enjoy learning from you.</p>

<p>I’m in a point where I feel very confortable with RequireJS and Knockout, but I have doubts about the next step I have to take, should it be Durandal or should it be AngularJS?</p>

<p>From your pluralsight courses, it seems that it should be Durandal, since it uses RequireJS and KnockoutJS (that I already know); but I’ve noticed (or at least this is the impression that I have) that currently you are not publishing anything about Durandal but a lot of stuff on AngularJS. This makes me doubt about what is the future of Durandal…</p>

<p>My question is, from your point of view, in a situation like mine, is learning and developing under Durandal a good investment? Or should I forget about what I already know about Knockout and go for AngularJS? I understand that AngularJS has a longer learning curve, but I’d like to move to the winning horse and stay with it for a good period of time.</p>

<p>I know that probably there is not a back or white answer, but I’d like to know your thinking about this,</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for your advise,</p>
