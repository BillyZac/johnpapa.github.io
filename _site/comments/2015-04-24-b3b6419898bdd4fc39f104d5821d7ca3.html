<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I hope you’re doing awesome.</p>

<p>Regarding your NuGet package for HotTowel MVC, the installation gives the following dependency errors (in all my projects where I’ve tried it out):</p>

<p>“Install-Package : Updating ‘Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Client 5.2.2’ to ‘Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Client 4.0.20710.0’ failed. Unable to find a version of ‘Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Core’ that is compat
ible with ‘Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Client 4.0.20710.0’.”</p>

<p>Is this a common problem ? Since the package hasn’t been I just wanted to reach out and see what’s up :-)</p>

<p>(Perhaps I should be looking at something else? I’m pretty new to MVC but a legend on webforms, so I may have missed an awesomely important message along my endeavours of course)</p>

<p>Cheers mate,
Tobias.
