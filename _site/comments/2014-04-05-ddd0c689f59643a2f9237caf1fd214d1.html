<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>In 3 days time, I’ve become a fan of you after reading your valuable posts and presentations. I watched the videos about hottowel angular breeze videos and learned a lot. Now I need to solve a few problems. First is how to upload an image, word doc. etc. to the database. Second is how to create a captcha. Is there any sample in hand or somewhere on the web?</p>

<p>Thank you so much.
