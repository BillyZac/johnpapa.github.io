<p>This was a little too much for a tweet, so just wanted to send a quick message.</p>

<p>Given the AngularJS team’s willingness to rewrite the framework and (according to the news coming out of ng-europe) make the number of radical changes they’re planning, is it reasonable to be concerned about writing an app using 1.3 now? There is a part of me that’s looking at it thinking that if they’re bold enough to do a full rewrite, they must be thinking there are much better ways to accomplish what they did in 1.x. I’d probably be more comfortable and it would be easier for me to think they’re anxious to build on the solid foundation they created if they were planning to incrementally build upon 1.3. But instead it looks like 1.3 might be the last 1.x release they add features to.</p>

<p>The bottom line for me is that scrapping many things folks are currently using makes me very hesitant to run out and build an app using 1.3. I’m sure 2.0 will be great, but who wants to be faced with using a framework now that will be done with features in the near future?</p>

<p>As always, I appreciate and respect any thoughts you have.</p>

<p>– Cory
