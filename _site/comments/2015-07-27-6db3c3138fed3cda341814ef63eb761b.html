<p>Hi John. My name is Aryeh. I working on testing directives, but I haven’t found a way, using your best practices, using a global function as the controller. Instead I have seen examples of directive testing using .controller. in angular-ui bootstrap. The company I work for wrote their directives using your best practices, but are now having trouble writing tests. Thanks!
