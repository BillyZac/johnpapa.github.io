<p>Hi,
I’ll try not to waste too much of your time, so let’s start.</p>

<p>Who am I?
Guy from northeastern Poland ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bia%C5%82ystok ), member of a local .NET user group since many years. Now I’m not only regular member, but I organize this meetings, and want them to be the best and most popular in Poland ;). That’s why I allowed myself to bother you.</p>

<p>What I came up with?
Is it possible, or even appropriate asking you for help?. Is it possible, that you could record a special short video where you greet our community, say something about Białystok, or just try to pronounce this name? (this might be difficult enough :D) It doesn’t need to be long, even few seconds will be enough, just say hello to our community. Scott Hanselman already agreed  ;) https://twitter.com/bstoknet/status/469228427078553601 I hope you also will.</p>

<p>All the best.
Mateusz Andrzejewski
