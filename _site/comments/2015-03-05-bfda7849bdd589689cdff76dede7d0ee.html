<p>Hi John</p>

<p>I’m interested in toastr and was wondering if you’ve ever considered trying to position the toastr in the centre of the screen rather than having it positioned in one of the corners or across the top or bottom?</p>

<p>I tried playing around with the css having seen the top-center and bottom-center styles in there but just couldn’t work out how to have it positioned both horizontally and vertically in the middle of the screen.</p>

<p>Is this something you’ve tried also (but failed) or just never considered?</p>

<p>Cheers
Nick
