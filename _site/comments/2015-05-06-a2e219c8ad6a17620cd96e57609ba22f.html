<p>Hi,
I created a Yeoman generator based on your GitHub repo “hottowel-angular-typescript” where I added sub generators for controllers, directives and services.</p>

<p>All very basic but if you’re want to look at it, just tell me what to do. I would create a PR but it’s not really based on any of your repos (maybe a mix of hottowel-angular-typescript and generator-hottowel :-)</p>

<p>Your blogposts, presentations, courses are great, by the way. Keep it up.
