<p>John,</p>

<p>Your presentation at TechEd this year was great.  One question I didn’t get to ask is what happened between you and KnockoutJS?  I mean, a year ago you were basically a Knockout evangelist.  Since then, not a peep.  We adopted knockout based on a lot of your of you evangelism, now it seems you direct us to re-plumb with angular.  Please explain your falling out.</p>

<p>Kind regards,
