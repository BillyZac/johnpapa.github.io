<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I thought I would give you a shout out here where I could perhaps ask a few more questions.</p>

<p>I have been a MS stack based developer for many years now. I started out building great LOB applications with Silverlight, it then got discontinued, I then moved to WPF and have been doing WPF work and during the whole time been deeply involved with WCF and all the rest of the wonderful back end systems. I worked for Sage and lead the R &amp; D  department.</p>

<p>I decided to take a step back and start my own business, as I had great ideas (In my opinion of course:) ) and could never implement any of these while working a full time job.</p>

<p>I became a Microsoft partner a few months back and recently got into the BizSpark program.</p>

<p>I started learning MVC about 2 months ago, and quickly became very proficient with it. It was only as I got a deeper understanding that what I wanted to achieve, using MVC simply would not work out for me.</p>

<p>It was during this trial and error phase, that I stumbled upon SPA’s. I started out with the course that Joe did on Pluralsight, but had problems from the start, the bits that I was using, as in all the latest packages and so on, the code did not work, as I am extremely new to this web world, I tried my absolute best and Joe also tried to help, but we could not get it running.</p>

<p>I then moved like I did with Silverlight and was thankful to see that you are on this same topic once again. I started out watching your Single Page Applications With ASP.NET. Afterwards I thought right Durandal here we come, I did some research on it and saw that they are now converging Durandal and AngularJS. In a sense I was back at step one.</p>

<p>Where do I start today, learning, training for what is current and is going to be current at least long enough for us to start and finish the project?</p>

<p>I do not want to start on Durandal today and tomorrow learn that I need to, well perhaps not need to, but would want to migrate to the converged code between Durandal and Angular. I hope you understand what I am trying to avoid.</p>

<p>I did look at your courses on Plural sight but also saw they were all done around a year ago, well that is what I can see from my side. After my experience with Joe’s course, going that far back to start this training with everything evolving so quickly and rapidly, it is more of a pain in the neck than anything else.</p>

<p>The course I started was meant to be around 5 hours, so I though OK I will take out 10 hours and that should be sufficient to cover it. 4 days later and I am not even half way through, because every new module, there are too many changes for the code to simply just work.</p>

<p>I am sure that if I use, MVC 4, pull the specific version in of Angular and MVC and Angular and all the specific versions of the various nugget packages, it will most likely work. But I think you see the problem in doing that.</p>

<p>I would really appreciate any guidance or advice that you could share on this matter.</p>

<p>Regards</p>
