<p>One question though. You suggest using names like these:
app.config.js
app.module.js</p>

<p>How do you work around Gulp reading the files in alphabetical order? I have (what I guess is normal) a glob read on src/<em>*/</em>.js so it will read the config first and complain there is no “App” module available.
