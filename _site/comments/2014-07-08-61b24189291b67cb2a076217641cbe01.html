<p>I just wanted to take a second to say thank you for your Building Apps with Angular and Breeze series on Pluralsite. Our own in house development team of a mighty 2, of which I am half,  is about to undergo a complete rebuild of an older large pre MVC.net in house application and without your thoughtful and well constructed lessons, Breeze and Angular would still be a mystery to me.</p>

<p>Because of your great work, we are pretty confidant that using Breeze and Angular together is the correct path for us to follow for our ground up application rebuild.</p>

<p>Also, if you get a chance could you list all of the different Plugins you use for VS and Sublime somewhere.  I find in the Play by Play series I catch a gold nugget of the different Plugins\extensions that are used by different developers and it would be great to see them listed maybe in a blog post or start a Twitter thread.</p>

<p>No need for a reply, thanks again!</p>

<p>-Matt
