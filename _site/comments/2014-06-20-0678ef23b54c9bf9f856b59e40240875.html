<p>Hi - I found your blog while trying to refresh our nuget of Angular and noticed we have both your AngularJS Core and someone else’s AngularJS package (http://www.nuget.org/packages/angularjs) which appears to contain many modules. I searched your blog but didn’t see - do you have any advice on including angular into a project, to start with all modules, add them as we need, or any other cherry-picking advice?</p>

<p>Thanks, Matthew
