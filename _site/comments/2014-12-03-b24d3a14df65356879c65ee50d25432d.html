<p>John,</p>

<p>I attended a few of your sessions at VSLive in Orlando, and just wanted to say I really enjoyed your talks.</p>

<p>I remember seeing a SpecHelper JavaScript file that I wanted to take a closer look at, but I can’t find it in any of the code samples I’ve downloaded. Is that something you can point me to?</p>

<p>Thanks!
- Paul
