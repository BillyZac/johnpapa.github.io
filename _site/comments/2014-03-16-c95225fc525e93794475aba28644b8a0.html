<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I just watched your pluralsight video on WinJS and are probably getting into deep water too quickly.</p>

<p>I have used the WinJS split template are querying a webservice every 5 seconds to get data, but I have trouble updating the bindinglist with the new data.</p>

<p>If I use window.setTimeout(bindData, 5000); to do the bindData as below, nothing happens although I have replaced the contents of list and re specified the listviews datasource.</p>

<pre><code>function bindData() {
    projects = getProjects();
    list = new WinJS.Binding.List(projects);
    projectsListView.itemDataSource = list.dataSource;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Would appreciate if you could give me any pointers.  I have also tried this code below…  It worked on the 1st page, but doing the same thing on the split page resulted on an Out of stack space error on ListView Inserted.   It also feels a bit long winded.</p>

<pre><code>function bindData() {

    projects = getProjects();
    list.splice(0, list.length);

    projects.forEach(function (project) {
        list.push(project);
    });

    window.setTimeout(bindData, 5000);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I would appreciate any help / pointers.</p>

<p>Thanks
Christo
