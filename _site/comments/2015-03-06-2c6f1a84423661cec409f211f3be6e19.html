<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>First, I would like to thank you for everything you’re doing to the JS community. I am new to the programming/development world in general, and currently I am between Ruby and Angular in the learning progress. I find what you and other developers do extremely informative.</p>

<p>I’ve, recently watched and enjoyed your Pluralsight course on AngularJS’s clean code, and I find myself a little lacking. I especially don’t understand the part about the “blocks” modules and the routing and exception handling processes. Going through the code on github, I am a little confused with the annotation comments because I don’t fully understand which tasks they relate to on Gulp, and how I would otherwise implement them without Gulp.</p>

<p>I was wondering if you would point me to the direction of an article or material  where I could find more information about this exact implementation.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for your time,</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Ahmed
