<p>Hello JohPapa,</p>

<p>How are you?</p>

<p>Could you help me? I trying to get one controller for nested state (ui-router).</p>

<p>Like:</p>

<p>I have follow:
company.html
company.router.js -&gt; it has an router provide to CRUD company’s contact (there is a new controller ContactController)</p>

<p>I want to access my array of contact on CompanyController.</p>

<p>How can i do this?</p>

<p>I’m using view model approach and define my controller on router with controller as (so I don’t need add ng-controller atribute on html)
