<p>Hi John, we had traded tweets the other day regarding Aerobatic. One thing I’ve been thinking about is that when devs deploy one of our starter apps, the index.html is just a basic image and heading. What I’m thinking to do is have our hello world app be a bootstrap template with links to next steps for the developer. One next step could be to refer them to some of your content to continue their education. LMK if this would be of interest to you. By way of example, here’s a link to our react starter app: https://github.com/aerobatic/react-starter</p>
