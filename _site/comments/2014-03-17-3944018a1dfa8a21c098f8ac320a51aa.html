<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I have been looking at your blog and the breeze/angular part 1 &amp; 2 videos on plural sight and had a couple of questions, there seems to be lack of knowledge integrating breeze and angular without .NET.  I am running a web service on a JBoss server with a rest service written in Java, I am able to connect to the service pull data from it (all thanks to your videos and the examples from the breeze site).  But when I try to saveChanges the object cannot be mapped properly and so it fails.</p>

<pre><code>var newPerson = dataservice.createPerson({
  id: -1,
  name:"test me new",
  ethnicity:"",
  description:"",
  img:""
});

extendPerson(newPerson);

dataservice.saveChanges([newPerson]);
</code></pre>

<p>My data service saveChanges section:</p>

<p>function saveChanges(entities) {
    return manager.saveChanges(entities)
      .then(saveSucceeded)
      .fail(saveFailed);
  }</p>

<p>I know this is a long shot, it might make for a good blog post for us developer tied to different servers.  I looked at the Hibernate example, and I am still not sure why the object I am creating cannot be be mapped properly (I am using a jsonResultsAdapter based on the edmunds example).</p>

<p>Thanks for your time,
-Alessandro
