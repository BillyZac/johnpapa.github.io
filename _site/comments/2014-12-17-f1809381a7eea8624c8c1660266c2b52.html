<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>Not sure if this is the best place to contact you about this but…</p>

<p>I am currently working through your “Building Apps with Angular and Breeze - Part 1” and cannot seem to connect to my CodeCamper database in my project. I get a error “Error: Cannot open database “CodeCamper” requested by the login. The login failed.”</p>

<p>I am using VS 2012 and i have install all the right packages as instructed.</p>

<p>Hope you can help.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
