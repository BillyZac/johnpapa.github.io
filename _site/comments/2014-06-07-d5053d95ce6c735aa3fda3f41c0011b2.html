<p>I just finished watching your classes on Pluralsight dealing with creating a web site using breeze and angular.  After watching it I had a question.  If I am using breeze for my web site does it make sense to just use sql server compact?  I saw that it was very limited in what it supports but it seemed like using breeze you never do anything directly with the db and breeze takes care of a lot of the heavy lifting.  I figured it was worth asking because it seems much easier to stick a database file in your web project like you did in your example than to have to have it hosted.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
