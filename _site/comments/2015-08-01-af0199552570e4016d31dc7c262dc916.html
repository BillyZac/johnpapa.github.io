<p>hi john, maybe this is not the best way to approach you for such simple questionI have regarding angular.</p>

<p>on ng-demos/modular you initialize the routes of each module in the .run block instead of in the .config block, I do know the difference of execution between those two blocks.</p>

<p>But most examples or docs out there define routes in the .config block.</p>

<p>Where is the advantage of doing it in the run block? is there some performance advantage trying to initialize routes only when the actual app module is run? i guess..</p>

<p>well hope you can enlighten me.</p>

<p>sorry to disturb you on this channel.</p>

<p>great angular knowledge you have, thanks for sharing</p>

<p>cheers,
denis
