<p>Good morning, John!</p>

<p>My name is Laura Foley and I help people to be less terrible at PowerPoint. I just got off the phone with Andy Newman of Pluralsight; we were talking about the possibility of my becoming a Pluralsight author.</p>

<p>Instead of teaching people the basics of how to use the software, I tell them why they should do things in a particular way. For instance, the importance of branding, how to create interesting content that the audience would enjoy, features vs. benefits, etc.</p>

<p>I was wondering if you might share some insights as to what it’s like to be a Pluralsoft author. It sounds like a pretty sweet deal, so I wanted to check with authors to learn about their experience.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your help. Have a great day!</p>

<p>~ Laura Foley
