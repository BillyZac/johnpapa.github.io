<p>John, are you planning to make a more structured HotTowel package that conforms to your post http://www.johnpapa.net/angular-growth-structure/? I would not go there if this is on your todo list.</p>

<p>My other question is: do I need to preserve any “John Papa” branding on the app started with HotTowel? I would guess not, but it is always better to confirm that I would not be violating something by removing all that information.</p>

<p>Thanks and regards</p>

<p>Nik
