<p>I have a question that I thought you might be able to give some insight on, but first let me say thank you for all of the content you publish, excellent stuff!  I am a pluralsight subscriber and have watched many of your videos.</p>

<p>My question is in regard to mobile first (with HTML5/JS) development.  I am building an app that I think will mostly be used by mobile devices, but there will be some desktop users.  I am doing all client side dev in HTML5/CSS/JS.</p>

<p>I initially was thinking of using bootstrap with hand held devices, but started looking at jquery mobile to get some mobile look and feel (touch) involved.  They do not really go together, so I am wondering what you would suggest.  I know it is an apples to oranges question between the two, but I am most worried that I am not thinking about the domain (mobile sites) and do not have enough experience to know which to choose.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time!</p>
