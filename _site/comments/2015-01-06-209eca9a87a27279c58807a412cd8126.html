<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I hope its not rude to send you a question by email.</p>

<p>I’ve been watching your pluralsight “Single Page Apps with HTML5, Web API, Knockout and jQuery” videos and they are great!</p>

<p>I’m planning to base a new project of our company based on CodeCamper as “template”.</p>

<p>In several other implementations (of web api &amp;EF ) I’ve seen an additional layer called service layer which hold all business logic code , this layer doesn’t exists in your solution.</p>

<p>Where would you write all business logic code ? in the Web API controller or in the EF Repositories ?</p>

<p>Thank you
Shahar
