<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I was wondering if you have an example of an authenticated api call for the hot towel angular app using webapi2? I understand the authentication process has changed with webapi2 to use bearer tokens rather than cookies, but this doesn’t seem to be working in the hot towel angular template.  The application works perfectly other than when I tried to make a call to an api marked with the [Authorize] attribute.</p>

<p>Thanks for all your work by the way. Makes my life as a programmer so much more fun!</p>
