<p>Hello John,
Thanks for replying to my tweet last night about end-2-end testing with real REST calls, this was very helpful. I have looked at the examples in ngDemo. I am able to test my dataService using real REST calls. But when I want to test the same services through my angular controller I have a basic problem, I don’t know how to use midway to create my controller. I have condenced the problem in  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26528026/using-midway-to-test-angularjs-controllers</p>

<p>Could you take a look, I have the feeling it is something simple that I am missing…</p>

<p>Thanks…</p>

<p>Nigel…
