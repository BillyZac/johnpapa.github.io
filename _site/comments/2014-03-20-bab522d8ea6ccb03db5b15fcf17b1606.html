<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>A few weeks back, I relaunched a small project of mine. It’s a simple repository of links to help others learn and read about webdesign.</p>

<p>You’ve made the list for being so awesome :)</p>

<p>Please see: http://www.webdesignrepo.com</p>

<p>Just wanted to say you’re doing, and have always done, a stellar job with the blog. Top notch!</p>

<p>Like I said, I really am just doing this to help people (I often see the same questions in the forums I visit over and over ie. ‘What design blogs should I follow?’). Of course, I expect nothing for this, but any amount of exposure you could offer, no matter how small or trivial it may seem, would be greatly appreciated :)</p>

<p>Keep up the fantastic work mate,</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Ben
