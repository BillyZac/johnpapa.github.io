<p>Thought i’d throw this web idea by you. Not sure I have the skills myself to build into a parser but since you are microsoft it might give you guys some ideas.
I was thinking for the next iteration of javascript of how things could be improved.
Kind of an different approach to dealing with collections by defining ‘..’ like iterating vs ‘.’ for single. so like you want to pull out FirstName out of a collection you might do something like</p>

<p>names = people..FirstName
or iterate
people..{
  alert .FirstName
}</p>

<p>kind of taking from functional programming:</p>

<p>ep1 = api ‘/api’</p>

<p>ep1.people..{
	alert .FirstName
}</p>

<p>ep1.person name=’Trevor Scharf’ {
	alert .JobTitle
}</p>

<p>or even a shorter hand one of defining similar to a with statement the shorthand ‘.’ in a scope</p>

<p>epi = api ‘/api’
.= epi</p>

<p>.people..{
	alert .FirstName	
}</p>

<p>.person name=’Trevor Scharf’ {
	alert .JobTitle
}</p>

as like a global definition that you can always extend in script and then users can use them in their enumerations like so  where you can access the current object using ‘.{propertyname}’ and do some pretty interesting stuff.</p>

<hr />

<p>people..{
	alert ‘Person in front of ‘ + .FirstName + ‘ is ‘ + :next.FirstName
}</p>

<p>people..{
	alert <code>Person in front of {.FirstName} is {:next.FirstName}</code>
}</p>

<p>add = {
	r= :first;
	while(:next){
		r += :next;
		:move-forward
	}
	return r;
}</p>

<p>r1 = add 1 2 3
/* 6 */</p>

<p>Let me know your thoughts.</p>
