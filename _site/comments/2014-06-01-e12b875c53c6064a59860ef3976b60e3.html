<p>Howdy John,</p>

<p>I’ve been watching your Pluralsight videos on HotTowel Angular with Breeze (thanks for making those, and nice job!). I am planning on using the setup to make a proprietary web app. Are their any licences (like the Metro King Theme) that I would need to purchase, or any copyrights that I should be aware of, or is it all fair game?</p>

<p>Thanks!
Jason
