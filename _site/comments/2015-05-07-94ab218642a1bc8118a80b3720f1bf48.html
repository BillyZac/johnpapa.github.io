<p>I’m going through your Pluralsight course, Building Apps with Angular and Breeze, and I noticed that the intellisense in your version of visual studio is far more complete (maybe enhanced is the right word) than what I have in VS 2013 for Angular, Breeze, etc.</p>

<p>Are you using some kind of VS plugin for your intellisense?
