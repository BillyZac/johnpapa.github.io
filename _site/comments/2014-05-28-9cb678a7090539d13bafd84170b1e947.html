<p>Would you be interested in doing a 3-4 day training in KC on JavaScript, SPAs, Durandal and the transition to the next version on Angular?  We try to do a training session for all of our developers on site at least once a year and would like to focus on those things for the next one.</p>

<p>We use JavaScript all the time for a number of single page apps, so we’re not looking for an intro level training.</p>

<p>it’s 20-30 developers, on site in our office in KC.  We can have a number of senior developers, well versed in JS and SPAs to help proctor, since that’s a large class.</p>

<p>We have had Shawn Wildermuth and Udi Dahan in past years.</p>

<p>thanks! tom
