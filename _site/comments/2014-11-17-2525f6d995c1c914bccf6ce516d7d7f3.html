<p>Dear John,</p>

<p>On behalf of the Content Committee for the 10th annual Philly Emerging Tech Conference, I’m writing to invite you to do a session on Angular 2.0. The event, which is also known as “Emerging Technologies for the Enterprise” and “Philly ETE,” is set for April 7 and 8, 2015, at the Society Hill Sheraton in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Your round trip airfare and hotel room at the conference venue would be covered.</p>

<p>The conference venue is within a few blocks of “Nerd St.”, which is actually North 3rd Street, the heart of Philadelphia’s thriving tech scene. An active member of the tech community noticed that “N. 3rd” looks like “Nerd”. Numerous technology-related businesses are clustered in this neighborhood, and the co-working space Independents Hall is based here too.</p>

<p>The conference features sessions covering a diverse mix of technologies and programming languages, in addition to talks about learning and creativity, We have hosted many creators or core developers of open source projects.</p>

<p>Most of the attendees are developers. Some are managers of technical teams. We’re expecting between 400 and 500 people to register. The conference has sold out the last six years.</p>

<p>Past speakers include Rich Hickey, John Resig, Douglas Crockford, Rod Johnson, Ryan Dahl, Doug Lea, Brian Goetz, Adrian Holovaty, Jonas Boner, Aaron Patterson, Ken Schwaber, Ron Jeffries, Chris Wanstrath, Linda Rising, Ambrose Bonnaire-Sergeant, Lukas Ruebbelke and Brian Ford.</p>

<p>Here is a link to the complete roster from last year’s Philly Emerging Tech conference website: http://phillyemergingtech.com/2014/speakers</p>

<p>This year’s roster is a work-in-progress. Confirmed session speakers include ReactJS core developer Pete Hunt, Ember creator Yehuda Katz, TC39 Project Editor Allen Wirfs-Brock and Jay Kreps, formerly of LinkedIn.</p>

<p>Session slots are 60 minutes long. We leave it to speakers to determine how much time to leave for Q &amp; A.</p>

<p>Like everyone else on the content committee, I am a developer, not a professional conference promoter. The conference is primarily driven by the local development community.</p>

<p>My employer, Chariot Solutions, is the founder and primary sponsor of the conference, but we always open the content committee to all the attendees of the previous year’s conference. Chariot (www.chariotsolutions.com) is a consulting firm that specializes in Java and Open Source Technology; Chariot is not in the conference planning business. These conferences are not a source of revenue for Chariot.</p>

<p>We aim to keep ticket prices as low as possible, while still covering travel and hotel expenses for all of the speakers and providing screencasts of the conference sessions for free online. You can view the screencasts from the 2014 conference here: http://emergingtech.chariotsolutions.com/tag/ete2014/</p>

<p>Some other reasons to make the trip to Philadelphia this spring:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You can see what’s left of the ENIAC on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania: http://www.seas.upenn.edu/about-seas/eniac/index.php.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Barnes Foundation Philadelphia location is another attraction that is best experienced in person. Albert Barnes arranged his Matisses, Picassos, Renoirs, Modiglianis, and Vincent van Goghs to in “wall ensembles” to highlight formal design principles. Details: http://www.barnesfoundation.org/about/</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Mercer Museum is located outside of Philadelphia. At the beginning of the Industrial Age, museum founder Henry Mercer had a vision that it would be important to preserve every day objects from the early 1900s, like Contestoga wagons and barrels and hand tools used by hat makers and broom makers. He realized how powerful it would be to view these artifacts in a museum setting and not just in photographs. Mercer designed a 6-story poured concrete structure to house his collection. He mounted objects in alcoves, on the ceilings, and on available wall space between alcoves: http://www.mercermuseum.org/exhibits/permanent-exhibits/</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Philadelphia’s Magic Gardens are 3 adjoining rowhouses completely covered with mosaics: http://www.philadelphiasmagicgardens.org/</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>
