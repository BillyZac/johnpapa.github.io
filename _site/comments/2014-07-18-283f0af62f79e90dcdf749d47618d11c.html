<p>Hello John,</p>

<p>I wanted to inquire about the possibility of you coming to Charlotte, NC and presenting at an upcoming Enterprise Developers Guild monthly meeting. We are thinking the topic would be on AngularJS but are open to suggestions. Let me know what you think. I certainly think our members would enjoy listening to you. Thanks!</p>
