<p>I would have tweeted you this question, but I figured it would require more than a 140 character response.</p>

<p>I just watched your presentation on AngularJS from TechEd and I guess my overarching question is this: “What do you see as the biggest benefits to using AngularJS as opposed to ASP.net MVC?”</p>

<p>I feel that much of what AngularJS does can also be accomplished with ASP.net MVC, and if I am an experienced ASP.net MVC developer what would be the reason for me to say… “I am going to build this next application using AngularJS instead.”</p>

<p>I have a desire to always expand my knowledge with new Frameworks and best practices, but I don’t just want to jump on a bandwagon if I don’t see a huge benefit in development productivity or end-user experience.</p>

<p>Thanks!
