<p>I am currently working on your gulp class on plural sight. I am at the part where I am automating dev serving with nodemon. For some reason, I can’t nodemon to do any of the .on actions. So for example .on(‘start’ ,function (){console.log(“it started”)}….. does not work, even though the nodemon script is running my server, it just seems to be ignoring those .on things…</p>

<p>I tried to send you a message the other day on gchat but I figured this would be better. Thanks in advance!</p>
