<p>Hello John,</p>

<p>I just have a few comments regarding your Pluralsight course “Single Page Apps with HTML5, Web API, Knockout and jQuery”. It is a good course but a few things make it very difficult to follow.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You didn’t build the project from scratch. You showed how the projects were created initially but soon after you demonstrated parts of the project with all the files in place. I don’t think this is ideal way to learn, it would be much better if we build some parts, test, then build, test etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This NLipsum thing is very annoying, I have no idea what it is and my VS2015 can’t resolve it. I’ve tried everything including copy all the folder contents in my local VS project folder. I don’t even think it is necessarily, really don’t understand why you decided to include this esoteric feature in a beginner course. Please give me some tips on how I can get NLipsum working.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I tried opening the project folder sln directly from VS and it says it can’t be opened.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>thanks
