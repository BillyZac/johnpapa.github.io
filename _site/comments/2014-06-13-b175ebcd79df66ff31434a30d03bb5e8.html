<p>Just finishing up your HotTowel Angular course on PluralSight. Great job, but the Breeze dependency is a sticking point for me in my current environment (going against an old Oracle 9i DB which doesn’t play nice with current EF versions).</p>

<p>Are you aware of any localStorage/WIP javascript libraries that aren’t dependent on Breeze.js?</p>

<p>Thx…Scott
