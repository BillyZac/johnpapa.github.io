<p>Hello John,</p>

<p>I’ve been learning angular and javascript and your blog and pluralsight courses have been a big help. I’m trying to get better at separating my concerns and moving functionality out of my controllers and into services/factories, but I have a question. In your style guide you recommend to always use factories for consistency as they are so similar to services. The issue I have is that the factory can either return an object or a constructor function that has to be new’ed up. How do you make it explicit to the client of the service which they need to do?</p>

<p>var myService = dataService vs var myService = new dataService();</p>

<p>I’m patterning my services somewhat similar to this blog https://medium.com/@tomastrajan/model-pattern-for-angular-js-67494389d6f. What I am thinking is for data services using an angular.service like productDataService that handles the rest communication and is injected into a productModelFactory that uses angular.factory that returns a constructor function. All business logic for the product would reside on the instantiated model instead of the controller and communication is delegated to the productDataService. I could do this with just factories, but then it leaves me having to remember how to use it. Hmm, thinking about it after typing this up I realize all I have is a name, not a type, when I do injection and could just use productModel and productDataService to inform about whether to new up or not…</p>

<p>I’d still like to get your opinion on the matter though. I could just use factories and use the name to inform the caller of how to use it, or I could separate it out into services and factories and do the same thing. In my opinion those two names hold a certain meaning and to me factory would build objects and service would perform services. But I don’t know that the separation would gain me anything, except maybe documentation, when all I have is a name when injecting.</p>
