<p>Hey John,</p>

<p>First of all, your JavaScript Build Automation With Gulp course on PluralSight is extremely insightful and helpful. We are considering building out our build process with Gulp, and since we are also a .NET shop, we look forward to the integration in VS2015.</p>

<p>Throughout the entire course I kept picking up on how you detailed what your favorite gulp plugins are, but I can’t quite figure out how you even begin to come up with a list. Searching for gulp on npm returns 6,000+ hits, and it does not appear to be sorted by number of downloads, etc. Looking around for registries that leverage an npm API to fill that void didn’t turn up much useful either.</p>

<p>I hope I’m not a bother contacting you directly about this, but it would be great if you could post on your blog a few tips on how to find quality gulp plugins!</p>

<p>Thanks so much again!</p>

<p>Simon
