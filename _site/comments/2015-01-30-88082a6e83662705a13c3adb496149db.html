<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>My name is Sam Bowling and I work at SingleHop, an industry leading cloud hosting provider. We’re asking a few influential writers to create articles to help us raise cybersecurity awareness as we enter into 2015 and I thought I’d see if you would be interested.</p>

<p>The past twelve months were very difficult for companies and consumers who were hit by a number of large, high-profile cyber attacks. We’ve curated a list of 5 Industries Devastated by Data Breaches in 2014 (https://www.singlehop.com/blog/5-industries-devastated-by-data-breaches-in-2014/). I’m hoping you’ll help us foster a discussion about cybersecurity by writing a post for your blog where you share your thoughts about these breaches. If you’ve had any personal experience with data breaches or cyber attacks that you would be willing to share I think it could really enrich the conversation as well.</p>

<p>I look forward to working with you to make 2015 a safer year for everyone online!</p>

<p>Thanks,
Sam
