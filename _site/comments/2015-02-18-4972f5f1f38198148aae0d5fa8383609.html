<p>Hi John,
    I hope you are doing well. I wanted you to know about an upcoming collaboration between Zen Digital and FITC. On May 5th, 2015, a full-day, one-track conference, Spotlight AngularJS NYC, will be held at the Scholastic Auditorium in SoHo, NYC. We were hoping you could find time in your schedule to speak on an AngularJS subject that interests you.</p>

<p>Talk time should be 45 minutes in length including any questions &amp; answers. If you are interested, please submit a one paragraph proposal for your topic.</p>

<p>Please find below a description of our event. I would love to hear your thoughts about it.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Daniel Zen</p>

<p>FITC Presents
Spotlight : AngularJS NYC</p>

<p>In association with Zen Digital
(One full day in May. Looking at May 5th)
1 day • 1 track • 250 attendees • 10am to 6pm • 7 presentations</p>

<p>FITC
FITC produces design and technology focused conferences and seminars worldwide, which inspire, educate and challenge attendees. Since 2002, FITC Events has brought together like-minded professionals and students in over 25 cities including Toronto, Amsterdam, Tokyo, San Francisco, Chicago, Seoul, New York, and Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The Event
The Spotlight event series is designed as a one day event on one specific tech area, allowing interactive professionals and students to build up their skills at a low price point with a minimal time commitment.</p>

<p>We started the Spotlight series of events two years ago in Toronto, and with the help of Zen Digital and the AngularJS NYC meetup, we’re excited to host it in NYC for the first time.</p>

<p>The Topic
The Spotlight series has focused on a number of areas, from Android to responsive design, but our most popular area has been AngularJS, most recently at FITC Spotlight: AngularJS, FITC Web Unleashed and FITC Spotlight Front-End. We are confident that it’s the perfect focus for our NYC event. And with AngularJS 2.0 on the horizon, we think there would be a great buzz about the topic in the Spring of 2015.</p>

<p>Since this is currently scheduled to be a one day, one track event, there will not be many slots.
