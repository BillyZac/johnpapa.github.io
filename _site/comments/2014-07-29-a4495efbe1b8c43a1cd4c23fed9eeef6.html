<p>I am getting ready to finally embark on some mobile development and I would like to start by going the hybrid route. Build the app in HTML5, CSS3, and JS and then package that up using PhoneGap and deploy. Do you have a pluralsight course that would cover that scenario or some other place that would be a good start for heading down that path?</p>

<p>Would you course on SPA development be a good fit for what I am thinking? I wasn’t sure if your SPA stuff was really for mobile websites or if that is more for building apps or if it can be used for both etc.</p>

<p>As you can tell I am really new to this but I have attended a few things at TechEd and see your name out there all the time. I attended your session at TechEd this year - loved it and you seem like a great guy.</p>

<p>Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated!!
Thanks,
Derek
