<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I found you via the Google Developer Expert program and am hoping you could help me out just a bit. I’m just getting started on a new app that will have mobile (native iOS and Android) apps and a web browser-based UI as well. I’m going to use App Engine and Cloud Endpoints for all of this part of the project, but can’t make heads or tails of what Google “wants developers to use” when it comes to building the web side. Polymer is an obvious push from Google, but it’s not clear to me how you’d wire that to Cloud Endpoints and it also doesn’t appear to work on older browsers.</p>

<p>If you were me, what combination of technologies would you be building something like this on (and tell me if you think I’m going down the wrong path with Cloud Endpoints)? Does GWT fit into this at all? How about Angular.js? Bootstrap? I’m not sure what parts I should be delving into (I’ll figure out how to make them work together later - right now, I don’t know where to begin on choosing the starting point technologies for the web side).</p>

<p>Note that our app will involve purchases and money, so working with tools that allow me to do the most with security will be key.</p>

<p>If you engage in any fee-based consultation on this in greater depth, please advise what an hour or so of your time would cost.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance,
Greg P.
