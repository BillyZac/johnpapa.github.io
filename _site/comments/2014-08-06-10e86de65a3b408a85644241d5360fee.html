<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>You’re a prominent thought leader in IT, while I’m no more than a beetle on a tree of life. Yet, I would like to help the ecosystem by focusing my task tracker, Pintask, on managing open source projects. Though current trackers like GitHub and Redmine already do a good job, I’m pretty sure everything could be done better, including the task tracking.</p>

<p>Would you mind sparing 30 minutes on Skype to help me understand the problems facing open source projects? I do have some hypotheses, but only your knowledge can verify them.
