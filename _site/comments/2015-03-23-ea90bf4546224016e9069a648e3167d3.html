<p>Hey John,</p>

<p>It was great meeting you at Ng-Conf 2015. Your Angular style guide project is really neat and I couldn’t be more excited about Angular 2 after the conference.</p>

<p>We had a quick chat about if it’d be possible for you to stop by in DC over the summer. To recap, I’m one of the organizers for the Tech Talk DC meetup (http://meetup.com/techtalkdc) with the companion Tech Talk DC blog (http://www.techtalkdc.com). Tech Talk DC is a new meetup that’s built upon a long running DC Alt.NET meetup; we’re rebranding and altering it to be focused on polyglots, best practices and craftsmanship to appeal to a wider audience.</p>

<p>You have a lot of followers in the DC area, and there’s a lot of excitement any time I mention the possibility of having you give a talk in DC. We’d love to have you speak at a special event meetup; we were considering perhaps having lightning talks with breaks in between for discussions, kicking off an anchor talk by you. This kind of a “gala” event could have a certain theme around it to keep the talks related to each other. As always, there would be plenty of mingling and enjoyment of some DC brews.</p>

<p>We are open to ideas or suggestions. If you’re interested or even if the logistics won’t work out please let me know – no worries either way!</p>

<p>Looking forward to hearing back from you,</p>
