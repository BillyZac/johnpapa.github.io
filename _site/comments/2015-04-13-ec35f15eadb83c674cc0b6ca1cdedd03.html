<p>Hi there!
I have an Angular question which I’m struggling with: I need to add a dependency to my main application module after the Angular has bootstrapped itself.
I know a module has an array of dependencies which I’ve tried pushing to but that seems to have no effect at all.  I don’t want to add the dep when Angular loads, I need more flexibility than that.</p>

<p>Any suggestions would be warmly welcomed.
Thank you
Gavin
