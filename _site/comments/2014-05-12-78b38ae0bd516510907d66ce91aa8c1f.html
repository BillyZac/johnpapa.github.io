<p>Dear Mr. Papa,</p>

<p>I have recently been asked to write modules for the DNN platform. I have little experience with ASP and C# thus I decided to utilize a more familiar approach by using Javascript and HTML but stumbled upon which framework to use for the module itself. The main purpose of the module will be analytics and general dashboard with information for the user. I am between KnockoutJS and AngularJS. Having worked with both I find myself conflicted with which to use. Knockout had lost momentum in recent years but is easier to setup. AngularJS has steep learning curve but is more feature complete. In your opinion which is the best approach for building DNN modules?</p>

<p>I am looking forward in hearing from you.</p>

<p>Kind regards,
Antonios Liakakis.
