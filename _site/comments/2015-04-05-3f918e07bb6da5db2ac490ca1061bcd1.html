<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I really appreciate your contribution to software industry, your tutorials and blogs really help us in building better web apps. I would like to ask a question regarding SPA using AngularJS. I was using your old architecture of CodeCamper for creating SPA. Now I want to shift to angularjs, but I am facing problem with client side datacontext. I don’t want to use breezejs because of its server side dependencies (breeze datacontext, EF etc). I don’t want to use EF on server and breeze does’nt work very well without EF. Kindly suggest any alternate approach for data layer with angularjs. I am thinking to use the same CodeCamper data model architecture with angularjs. Need your guidance :)</p>

<p>Thanks!
