<p>Hi John</p>

<p>I just watched your AngularJS play by play Pluralsight session with Ken. Firstly, what a fantastic video - I thoroughly enjoyed it!</p>

<p>I have been “doing” (so to speak) AngularJS for a few weeks now for my company and I learned a lot of cool things including John’s best practices and debugging tools/techniques.</p>

<p>Secondly, Ken’s question on “why would you choose angular over a more traditional ASP.NET MVC or PHP solution” I find very interesting and I would be very interested to hear your thoughts on the subject, as everybody seems to go angular crazy nowadays?</p>

<p>The reason why I ask is that the project I’ve slipped into is getting rather HUGE and I get the feeling that an architectural/design decision was not made on functionality but rather on “hey…angular seems kinda cool” :)</p>

<p>Where do you draw the line when deciding between ASP.NET MVC and AngularJS?</p>

<p>It would mean the world to me to hear your thoughts on the subject.</p>

<p>Cheers, Ben</p>
