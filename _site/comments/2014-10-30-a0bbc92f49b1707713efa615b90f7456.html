<p>Hello Mr. Papa, I’ve been going through your HT-NG-BZ Part 1 on pluralsight, but using my own database models.  I full admit I’m not professional programmer.  However once I got to the part about filtering I wanted to filter on a clientName and invoiceId, well the invoiceId is an int and when I hit the text contains everything blew up.  So I just added toString() in textContains to resolve that.  Not something you needed for the video series, but since folks are using your HT-NG-BZ as starter kit I thought it might be a nice addition for people trying to filter on numbers and using textContains.
