<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I hope you’re well. It has been a while since we worked together on some books at Wrox. Congratulations on all your achievements since then.</p>

<p>Somehow I’m still writing and editing books, currently for Manning Press. One of the books I’m working on is a really nice piece called SPA Design and Architecture (http://manning.com/scott2/) and I wondered if you might have the time to have a look at the book and consider writing a foreword for it?</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
