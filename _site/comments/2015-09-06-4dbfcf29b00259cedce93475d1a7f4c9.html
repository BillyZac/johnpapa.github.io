<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I have been diving into the code you wrote in one of your ng demos, cc-bmean, which made me turn to reading breezejs documentation and, since I come from PHP background, eventually dabbling at using Breeze with php using breeze.server.php. So I thought on using Breezejs with Angular in production soon, but today I read Angular 2 survey results http://tinyurl.com/q2lsc4k and in the ‘Data Libraries’ section, Breeze was only mentioned briefly. So that made me wonder what’s your personal choice for data library today, or if you would still recommend using Breeze.JS as data library (it’s been a year since cc-bmean has been authored after all).</p>

<p>Best regards.
