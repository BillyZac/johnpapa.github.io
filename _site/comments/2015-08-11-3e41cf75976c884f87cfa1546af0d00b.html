<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I have been following your blog and your twitter account and your articles are one of the ways I keep up with whats happening in web and .Net world. Thanks alot for that.</p>

<p>I am working in a company where we provide service to our customers like developing there line of business applications, supporting and maintaining there applications.</p>

<p>One of the challenges we face is that we don’t normally get an opportunity to work on any technology for extended period. In last 2 years I worked on Sharepoint for 4 months, WPF for 10 months, Angular for 7 months and now working for a customer where we are working on their 911 software which is mainly a windows application in C# and VB.Net.</p>

<p>As you would have guessed the biggest problem is keeping in touch with so many things and when you move around so much its just not possible to master anything. I see you and how you are so good in all web technologies and it inspires me to try to be like you.</p>

<p>My current role is Technology Architect and the expectations from me is that I should be very good in Design, Architecture, be aware of latest happenings in all parts of technology like whats happening in Sharepoint or whats happening in Web, in MVC, in Angular, new frameworks, whats happening in Windows universal apps and be hands on.
I am feeling overwhelmed by this expectations and not sure what is the best way I can achieve these.</p>

<p>I would really appreciate if you can share your thoughts on how can I become better Architect, Developer and what can be somethings I should definitely focus on like on Architecture, Design.</p>

<p>Thanks alot John
