<p>Hey John,</p>

<p>It’s an honor to greet you!</p>

<p>First of all, thank you for all these blog posts, for Hottowel and all PluralSight videos on AngularJS (and on other subjects as well), I watched every one of them, and they’re all great. Thanks a bunch!</p>

<p>Now, to the question:
Could you show me a sample of code of YOUR way how to connect to some server API (in my case it’s Web API 2) via AngularJS $resouce through some service/factory.</p>

<p>I would like to see how do you make controller and service communicate when getting/saving/changing data.</p>

<p>My friend and I couldn’t find much of quality samples online regarding $resource service except for ‘get’ method, which is quite surprising.</p>

<p>I’m saying YOUR because I would really like to see your approach to this particular thing and I couldn’t find it in your GitHub repositories.</p>

<p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>

<p>Best regards,
Ibro
