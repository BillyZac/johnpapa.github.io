<p>Hey John, I love your material, and have attended your courses.  You are my go-to AngularJS guru!</p>

<p>There is an issue with the SideWaffle template for AngularJS TypeScript Controller-As template.  It has been broken since Angular upgraded to 1.3.  I have been trying to conquer this issue on my own, but it is beyond my Angular expertise.</p>

<p>Here is the issue documented in the GitHub thread:
“AngularJs Typescript Controller Template causes problems with Angular 1.3”
https://github.com/ligershark/side-waffle/issues/182</p>

<p>Here is more information on the issue, illustrated in a Plunkr:

<p>Thanks! -Rob
