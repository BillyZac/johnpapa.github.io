<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I am following your course on Gulp over Pluralsight and I noticed that in brackets there is a popup windows that appears whenever your have jshint issues in the file. I tried many hours and was not able to trigger that functionality myself.</p>

<p>Would you mind share, again, the knowledge?</p>

<p>Is it an extension, a bracket option, etc.</p>

<p>I find it really fascinating and I would like to have it if you don’t mind.</p>

<p>Kind regards,</p>

<p>Ami
