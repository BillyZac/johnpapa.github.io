<p>Thanks for the great intro to angular and the comp Pluralsight subscription. I’ve started thinking about using more js and here’s my question based on your intro in the angular-breeze lecture:</p>

<p>I understand js is great for getting the most of the data at the beginning, Is js appropriate for a web app that either polls the database regularly for updates (i’m thinking of, say, a dashboard showing average miles/per/gallon every 10 second)?</p>

<p>Thanks,
Dave
