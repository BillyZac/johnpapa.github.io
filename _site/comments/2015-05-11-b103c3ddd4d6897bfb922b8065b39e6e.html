<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I am from Brazil. I’m finishing my undergraduate CS course and part off that is a SPA using angular and Neo4J.</p>

<p>I’m taking your course at PluralSight, but using the code example of 42id ANNE STACK.</p>

<p>Do you plan create a course about ANNE ?</p>

<p>Can you suggest same specific tutorial or curse ?</p>

<p>My course was focused in Java and C. AngularJs is challenging me…</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Alan Aquino.
