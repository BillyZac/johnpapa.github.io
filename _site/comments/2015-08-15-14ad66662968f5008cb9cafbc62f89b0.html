<p>Hey John</p>

<p>Hope things are going well, you seem to be awfully busy lately (well probably always).</p>

<p>Crafting together a new client application and want to integrate Toastr.</p>

<p>Are you using <em>your</em> version, or do you use a custom directive (or something like this one).</p>

<p>Is there an “official” directive from you?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>
