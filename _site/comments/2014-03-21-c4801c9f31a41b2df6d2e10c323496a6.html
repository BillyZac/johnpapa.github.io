<p>Hi John</p>

<p>I’m working through your very good course on Pluralsight where you build your CodeCamoer SPA. Alot there to learn but I am trying to take out of it what I need as I re write part of our web application using some of the techniques you show.</p>

<p>What I am doing is putting together some functionality for our company’s CRM system. When the company delivers a version of its product to clients there may be issues with it and the tech support guys log thise issues. Each entry is known as a ProductVersionIssue.</p>

<p>So far I have got the Repository/Unit of work pattern returning a collection of ProductVersionIssues which I bind to a Kendo grid. It working fine.</p>

<p>However I have run into an issue. One of the fields of a ProductVersionIssue is TechSupportName and we store a username used company wide for the guy who with deal with the issue. The convention is say for me “Gary James” “gjames”. There is a table of users where each employee has a arow and the key is their username. In that table is the friendly name to display “Gary James”.</p>

<p>Of course so far my repository of ProductVersionIssues is pulling through the username when I really need it to show the display name held in the Users table. I cant seem to visualize the best way to go about achieving this using the repository patern. Maybe code in the UOW?</p>

<p>This of course would be for a no editable field but if I wanted to make this field a dropdown on the UI where the users can change the name of the TechSupport guy by choosing from a list of users and save that back,  what I would want to push back down to the ProductVersionIssue record is the new username chosen by the user of the SPA.</p>

<p>Could you be so kind as to give me some ideas on how to achieve this or point me in the right directions of an example?</p>

<p>Many Thanks</p>

<p>Gary
