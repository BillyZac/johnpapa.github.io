<p>Hi John</p>

<p>Thanks for the great tutorials and examples you have presented,</p>

<p>I am from a Flex/Java background and looking to see what the javascript community has been up to, over the (many) years of building on our current stack performance and consistency have become invaluable and the various teams have been a little code-nazi keeping in close guidelines with Adobe/Oracle etc…</p>

<p>This brings me to the code samples you have provided in your videos and within your github repo, I appreciate these are for teaching the specifics of the relevant course though leave many questions around performance.</p>

<p>Again I am new Javascript but do have an understanding of ECMAScript and likely am a bit confused but one thing I noticed in the various examples of controllers is the creation of properties/methods within the constructor, from what I understand this means each time the object is created those properties are also created and added to the object.</p>

<p>A few online articles suggest this being bad practice and to rather have this on the prototype, I can appreciate that for a controller we are not spawning thousands of these objects but for consistency reading any object graph within a project should be consistent.</p>

<p>Your view would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Many thanks
