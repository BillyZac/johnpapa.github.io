<p>John,</p>

<p>I came across an old article of yours discussing dataset vs datareader.  I also realize that you are now independent and not with Microsoft.</p>

<p>I was wondering a few things.</p>

<p>1) Could you update it with the current changes to the way we handle our data for ASP.NET/WCF 
2) Listen (read) to a scenario and quickly advise.</p>

<p>Scenario: Moving data from either a Oracle database or a remote database server to a Microsoft SQL Database (2012).
Using OracleDataReader, Oracle database has a 10 minute time out.  While the query executes immediately reporting back over 10,000 rows (but less than 15,000).  The connection times out during the move.  Is it being delayed during the DataTable.Load(DataReader) portion of the execution?
We see in the debug process where Oracle tells us “Time’s Up” at the line where the DataTable.Load is.</p>

<p>Would a DataSet be more appropriate?</p>

<p>Have you experienced this in the past?</p>

<p>Thank you for taking a non Angular question on.  I really appreciate your time.</p>

<p>How are liking living in Florida now?  Glad you are down here with us!</p>

<p>Hope to see you at Code on the Beach!</p>

<p>-MJ
