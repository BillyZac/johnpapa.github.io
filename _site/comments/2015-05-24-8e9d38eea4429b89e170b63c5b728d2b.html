<p>Hi I’ve been trying to follow your angularjs style guide and I have a question about using the controller as syntax with form validation.</p>

<p>I know I need to add a name to form to get it to work but I struggled with getting the $dirty or $invalid part to work.</p>

<p>If it’s not too much trouble would you be able to provide an example of using the controller as syntax with form validation.</p>

<p>Thank you,
Raff
