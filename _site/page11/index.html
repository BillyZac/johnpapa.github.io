    <a href="/azure/uncategorized/visual%20studio%202012/2013/01/26/publishing-a-web-app-to-windows-azure.html">Publishing a Web App to Windows Azure</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Often I like to test my web apps in a real website. For me, Windows Azure is ideally suited for this. I can spin up a site as needed, publish my demo, test it on a variety of devices, and tear it down when I am done. the best part is that it only takes a few moments to learn how to do this. What do you need? Just install Visual Studio 2012 and open a Windows Azure account and you are all set. In this post I’ll tell you how to set up an Azure website, how to publish to Azure, and offer several tips in case you run into issues along the way.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/publishing-a-web-app-to-windows-azure/1-25-2013-11-04-02-pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-14321"><img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/1-25-2013-11-04-02-PM.png" alt="1-25-2013 11-04-02 PM" width="580" height="213" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14321" /></a></p>

<h2>At a Glance</h2>
<p>In the Windows Azure Portal</p>
<ul><li>Sign up for an account with Windows Azure</li>
<li>Create a New Web Site</li>
<li>Download the publishing profile file</li></ul>

<p>In Visual Studio 2012</p>
<ul><li>Ensure all NuGet packages are installed</li>
<li>Build your solution</li>
<li>Publish your solution</li></ul>

<h2>Create a Windows Azure Web Site</h2>
<p>The first step is to <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/" target="_blank">sign up and create an account with Windows Azure</a>. Depending on what programs you are participating in you may qualify for different options. I’ll assume that you have signed up or can figure that out on your own. The next step is to create a web site in Azure. I don’t require a lot of resources for testing my apps, so when I create web sites for this purpose I just choose the smallest/cheapest options available. That is what I will go through here.</p>

<p><a href="https://manage.windowsazure.com" target="_blank">Go to your Windows Azure portal</a> and select the plus sign in the bottom left hand corner.
<a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/publishing-a-web-app-to-windows-azure/azure-new-site/" rel="attachment wp-att-14181"><img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/azure-new-site.png" alt="azure-new site" width="600" height="485" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14181" /></a></p>

<p>Then choose the Web Site option, and the Quick Create option. From here, it will ask you to type in the url you want. It automatically places you in the azurewebsites.net domain. (You can reconfigure  this later if you want to use a domain that you own.) I typed in papademonstration so I get papademonstration.azurewebsites.net. I trust you will pick something far shorter :)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/publishing-a-web-app-to-windows-azure/azure-quick-create/" rel="attachment wp-att-14211"><img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/azure-quick-create.png" alt="azure-quick create" width="550" height="170" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14211" /></a></p>

<p>In my experience, it will take anywhere from 30 seconds to a few minutes to spin up the new site. When using the Quick Create you get a very simple setup. You can configure your domain name, whether you want to share a virtual server or get a reserved server, how many cores, instances, memory and so on. For this post, I’m just focusing on the simple route where you want to spin up a site so you can test your app, and for that the Quick Create is all I’ll need.</p>

<h2>Publishing Profile</h2>
<p>Next you are going to want to know how to connect Visual Studio to Azure so you can publish your project to it. For this you will need the publishing profile. Once the web site’s status says <code>running</code> instead of <code>creating ...</code>, click on the name of the web site in the Azure portal. You will then see the dashboard for that new site. On the right you will see a section titled <code>quick glance</code>. From here you can click the link to <code>download publish profile</code>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/publishing-a-web-app-to-windows-azure/azure-dashboard/" rel="attachment wp-att-14241"><img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/azure-dashboard.png" alt="azure-dashboard" width="308" height="274" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14241" /></a></p>

<p>This will download the profile to your computer. It is a text file and if you open it you can see it contains sensitive information about connecting to your site.</p>

<h2>Publish in Visual Studio</h2>
<p>Next, go to Visual Studio 2012 and open your project. Be sure that all of the NuGet packages are installed properly and that you have just re-built the solution successfully.</p>

<blockquote>Tip: I have found that the publishing process goes much smoother when you build immediately prior to publishing.</blockquote>

<p>While the project is selected, go to the Visual Studio 2012 menu and select Build and Publish.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/publishing-a-web-app-to-windows-azure/publish/" rel="attachment wp-att-14251"><img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/publish.png" alt="publish" width="419" height="321" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14251" /></a></p>

<p>You will see a dialog that allows you to import a profile. Click the import button and locate the publish profile you recently downloaded for your new web site. This is how you tell Visual Studio 2012 where to send your code. Then click the <code>next</code> button. I recommend clicking the <code>Validation Connection</code> button on the Connection dialog, just to verify it can communicate with the web site. Then click the <code>next</code> button and you will see the settings dialog, where you can choose which configuration to publish (release, debug, etc). Then click the <code>next</code> button again and yu will see the preview dialog. I recommend always coming to this dialog and click the <code>Start Preview</code> button. Sometime you will see “Preview Failed (click here for details)”. Often the error message it reveals is obtuse, so I simply close this, save any changes to the profile, clean and rebuild the solution and try again. It often works after that.</p>

<blockquote>Tip: Don't be scared if you see a message that says "Web.config not found". I think there must be a random strange error message generator that kicks in when the preview fails. I just ignore those messages as they rarely make sense and rebuild the solution. The messages might as well say "pigs are flying out your window" for all the help they are.</blockquote>

<p>Once you get a clean preview, you can click the <code>publish</code> button. All files are then sent up to the web site and it will open a browser and hopefully you will see your app!</p>

<h2>Avoiding Gremlins</h2>
<p>If you are like me, then you likely won’t hit the happy path each time your publish. It’s common for me to forget something and have to try again. Here are some more tips I have learned along the way that may help you if you read this far. If you didn’t, well, then, I might as well do a dance since you aren’t reading this far anyway. :)</p>
<h5>Rebuild</h5>
<p>Always rebuild right before you publish. Yes, i said it a few times in here, but it’s very important to staving off gremlins.</p>
<h5>Include Files</h5>
<p>Remember to include files in your Visual Studio 2012 project that you want published. If you don’t you can always FTP them later.</p>
<h5>Restart Web Site</h5>
<p>If you have problems publishing to your web site, go to the portal and restart the site. It takes about 5 seconds for me.</p>
<h5>FTP</h5>
<p>If you have problems publishing on top of existing files, consider FTP’ing to your site and clearing it manually. I had to do this once or twice myself.</p>
<h5>Miss a File?</h5>
<p>If a file did not get sent up to your web site, you can always FTP it.</p>
<h5>keep It Secret, Keep it Safe</h5>
<p>Your FTP credentials are in the publish profile (you may want to make sure you protect that file).</p>
<h5>SQL Server CE</h5>
<p>If you publish a SQL Server CE file (an *.sdf) for use with EntityFramework, make sure you have the <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/EntityFramework.SqlServerCompact/4.3.6" target="_blank">EntityFramework.SqlServerCompact</a> NuGet package installed before you publish. Otherwise you may see errors trying to connect to the database.</p>
<h5>What's the Real Error?</h5>
<p>If you see obtuse error messages, turn off customErrors in web.config to reveal the real error message (then be sure to undo this later).</p>

    <p>Most every team enjoys easy to maintain and well-organized code that follows a consistent pattern (whatever that pattern may be). When developing with JavaScript it is just as important to follow a pattern to help the developer behind you, perhaps because it is so easy not to. JavaScript is a dynamic language that provide great power. But with great power comes great responsibility. Otherwise, you can easily drive right off the map.</p>
<h2>Ravioli Code</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/typescriptpost/module-ravioli/" rel="attachment wp-att-13991"><img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/module-ravioli-300x224.png" alt="module ravioli" width="300" height="224" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-13991" /></a>An analogy I enjoy relates modules to ravioli. Code without modules might be strewn all over the place, tangled, hard to locate where the functionality you need lives. This is much like spaghetti code where you can’t tell where one set of code begins and ends. Modules help keep code with a specific role contained within the module. This makes it easy to identify which module performs what task or service. By separating the code into modules, or ravioli, it’s much easier to identify which ravioli the code you are looking for resides in.</p>

<p>One easy way to help maintain code re-use and organize your code is with modules. There are patterns such as the Revealing Module Pattern (RMP) in JavaScript that make this quite simple, but the good news is that in TypeScript modules become even easier with the <code>module</code> keyword (from the proposed ECMAScript 6 spec).</p>

<blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/DanWahlin" target="_blank">Dan Wahlin</a> and I recently released a new course for <a href="http://pluralsight.com" target="_blank">Pluralsight</a> that focuses on providing the fundamentals to write application-scale code using TypeScript.

<p>This post provides an overview on what’s in the 4th module of our course. This is part 4 of 4 in an article series where I describe the different areas Dan and I feel are fundamental to learning TypeScript. You can find the other posts here:</p>

</ul>
<h2>What's a Module?</h2>
<p>If you work on a team and want to make it easier for the developer behind you, modules can certainly help with that. There are other benefits to using modules too:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scoping of variables (out of global scope)</li>
<li>Code re-use</li>
<li>AMD or CommonJS support</li>
<li>Encapsulation</li>
<li>Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)</li>
<li>Easier for testing</li>
</ul>

<p>There are others, but I think you get the point here. Can you write great code without modules? Sure! But the benefits to using modules far outweigh the learning curve. I’ve found that when I start a project it really helps to think about the functionality in terms of which modules I may need. It is a similar process that I use for any language, and it flows well with TypeScript.</p>
<h2>TypeScript Modules</h2>
<p>TypeScript categorizes modules into internal and external modules. I like to further break out the internal modules into Implicit and Named. Each are still just modules, but how you define them and use them is important. (These terms are my own, simply to help me categorize modules. You won’t find them in the TypeScript spec.) For example, if you want to use AMD or CommonJS, you want to look at external modules. If you want to organize your code into files and define your own module names , then internal named modules are a good choice.</p>
<h2>Implicit Internal Modules</h2>
<p>Implicit internal modules are the easiest to work with as you simply just write source code without worrying about modules. For example the following code is the entire contents of a file that defines a and creates an instance of a class in TypeScript.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
class TestClass {
    private a = 2;
    public b = 4;
};
var t = new TestClass();
</pre>
<p>There’s a module in there. Do you see it? The entire set of code is in an implicit module that joins the global module / global scope / global namespace (whichever term you prefer).When you run this code you will find these variables on the window object. The point here is that you get a module out of the box as all variables are going to default tot he implicit module, the global module if you will, unless you specify otherwise.</p>

<p>Is this a good practice? I prefer not to go this route because it means you are putting everything in the global scope. <a href="http://oreilly.com/javascript/excerpts/javascript-good-parts/awful-parts.html" target="_blank">Global variables are bad in general</a>. However, it is important to know how your code will be treated if you ignore modules: you end up back with spaghetti.</p>
<h2>Named Internal Modules</h2>
<p>When you use the <code>module</code> keyword you are using (named) internal modules. All variables defined within the module are scoped to the module and removed from the global scope. The module itself is in the global scope (though you can nest modules too). The code below shows that the <code>Rectangle</code> class and <code>rect</code> variable are both scoped to the <code>Shapes</code> module. They cannot be accessed outside of the module, which is why the final like of code would show no members of <code>Shapes</code>.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
module Shapes {
    class Rectangle {
        constructor (
            public height: number, 
            public width: number) {
	}
    }
    // This works!
    var rect1 = new Rectangle(10, 4);
}

// This won't!!
var rect2 = Shapes._________
</pre>
<h2>Exports</h2>
<p>You could take that previous example and export what you want out of the module. In other words, you can make internal aspects of the module accessible outside of the module using the <code>export</code> keyword.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
module Shapes {
    export class Rectangle {
        constructor (
            public height: number, 
            public width: number) {
	}
    }
}
// This works!
var rect = Shapes.Rectangle(10, 4);
</pre>
<p>You an also extend internal modules, share them across files, and reference them using the triple slash syntax. Dan and I go deeper on this topic in module 4 of our course.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
///<reference path="shapes.ts" />
</pre>
<h2>External Modules</h2>
<p>When dealing with large JavaScript based applications it can be unwieldy to manage the sheer number of scripts you may have. The dependency chain itself can be daunting as well as knowing when to load which scripts. This is where using the AMD convention can really help. TypeScript supports AMD using external modules. This is a topic unto itself and Dan and I cover it in our course along with some recommendations on how to use it. For simple / small apps there may be no need to use AMD. But for apps that need to scale, TypeScript and AMD together can really shine. I also recommend using the <a href="http://requirejs.org/" target="_blank">require.js library</a> to help implement AMD. You can <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/spapost6/" target="_blank">read more about require.js in my post here</a> or in <a href="http://jpapa.me/spaps" target="_blank">module titled “SPA Basics: Separating the Ravioli” of my SPA course</a>.</p>

<p>When using AMD (or CommonJS) and external modules, you can export an entire module and then import it into another module. This defines a dependency chain that AMD and require.js can manage for you.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
// bootstrapper.ts file

// imports the greeter.ts file as the greeter module
import gt = module('greeter'); 
export function run() {
    var el = document.getElementById('content');
    var greeter = new gt.Greeter(el);
    greeter.start(); 
}
</pre>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
// greeter.ts file

// exports the entire module
export class Greeter { 
    start() {
         this.timerToken = setInterval(() =&gt; 
             this.span.innerText = 
             new Date().toUTCString(), 500);
    }
}
</pre>
<h2>Future</h2>
<p>There are a lot of great features in TypeScript and it’s still early. There is a <a href="http://typescript.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Roadmap" target="_blank">roadmap that the TypeScript team has published</a> and thankfully one of the features on that list is generics. I’d love to see that addition and frankly I’d love to see the modules fleshed out even more. The tooling is just OK in my opinion, but adding in Web Essentials 2012 really improves the experience markedly for development today. They also list async/await, mixins, tooling features, and further alignment with ECMAScript 6.  I expect all of these to improve as the team approaches its full release.</p>

<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>TypeScript is a new open source language that provides support for building enterprise scale JavaScript applications. Although several patterns exist that can be used to structure JavaScript, TypeScript provides container functionality that object-oriented developers are familiar with such as classes and modules. It also supports strongly-typed code to ensure inappropriate values aren’t assigned to variables in an application. This course will walk you through the key concepts and features that you need to know to get started with TypeScript, and use it to build enterprise scale JavaScript applications. You’ll learn the role that TypeScript plays as well as key features that will help jump-start the learning process.</p>
<h5>1: Getting Started with TypeScript</h5>
<p>TypeScript is a superset of the JavaScript language that offers several benefits to both client-side and server-side developers. In this module you’ll learn about the different features that TypeScript offers and see how it can be used with tools such as Visual Studio, Sublime Text and others to structure code and even catch issues as you’re writing code.</p>
<h5>2: Typings, Variables, and Functions</h5>
<p>This module covers the core features of TypeScript including the TypeScript grammar, optional type annotations, built in primitive types, ambient declarations, and special types. Also covered are arrow functions, simple interfaces, functions, objects and more.</p>
<h5>3: Classes and Interfaces</h5>
<p>In this module you’ll learn how classes can be defined and extended using TypeScript and the resulting JavaScript that’s generated. You’ll also learn about interfaces and the role they can play in adding consistency across classes.</p>
<h5>4: Modules</h5>
<p>This module explains what TypeScript’s modules are, how to identify them, when to use them, and various ways to use them with and without patterns such as AMD.</p>
<h2>More Details?</h2>
<p>While writing the course I wrote a series of posts the map loosely to the modules:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Part 1 – <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/typescriptpost1/" target="_blank">Getting Started with TypeScript</a></li>
	<li>Part 2 – <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/typescriptpost2/" target="_blank">TypeScript Grammar</a></li>
	<li>Part 3 – <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/typescriptpost3/" target="_blank">TypeScript Classes and Interfaces</a></li>
	<li>Part 4 – Modules - (coming soon)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you like this course, please rate it using Pluralsight’s new star rating system! We certainly appreciate your feedback.</p>
<h2>My Next Course Will be ...</h2>
<p>While the paint is still drying on the TypeScript course I’m mapping out the flow for my next course. I decided to create a course that goes step by step through building a rich web app. This fits in nicely as a beginner level course for building a SPA, slotting right before my <a href="http://jpapa.me/spaps" target="_blank">Code Camper SPA course at Pluralsight</a>. The existing SPA course covers a lot of ground for building a full featured Rich Web App (RWA) or SPA, and it demonstrates exactly how robust you can make yours web apps. Now it is time to go back and show from scratch how you can build a SPA from the ground up. It should be an exciting prelude that leads right into the existing SPA course as part of a learning path for the topic. I have several other ideas for courses after this next one, but I’m going to take it 1 at a time.</p>

    <p>It’s likely that you’ve used classes and interfaces in statically typed languages to organizing your code into logical units. When you work with JavaScript these constructs do not exist, so we use the excellent replacements like constructor functions and the module pattern. However, you may still miss classes and interfaces (which play together quite nicely) and if so, you may want to take a closer look at <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org" target="_blank">TypeScript</a>. Classes are being discussed for the next ECMAScript 6 revision, and as such, TypeScript has taken them under its wing.

<h2>Do I Need Classes?</h2>
<p>I generally consider 3 main conditions where I consider a class, regardless of the language.</p>
<ul><li>Creating multiple new instances</li>
<li>Using inheritance</li>
<li>Singleton objects</li></ul>
<p>There are others, but let’s look at these 3. For singletons I could just as easily use the Module Pattern, and frankly I generally do that with TypeScript. For creating instances, classes are nice but they are not necessary in JavaScript either.</p>

<p>Let me be clear that classes are pretty awesome, but it’s not like we can’t do these things in JavaScript today using other techniques. The reason TypeScript’s classes are valuable is not because you can’t do them today, it’s because they make it so much easier to do these things. If you want an example, try to write your own class structure that uses inheritance in JavaScript.</p>

<blockquote>If you take anything out of this post, take this: TypeScript makes it easier to write structured code, and part of that is using classes.</blockquote>

<h2>Creating a Class</h2>
<p>You can create a class and even add fields, properties, constructors, and functions (static, prototype, instance based). The basic syntax for a class is as follows:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
// TypeScript
class Car {
    // Property (public by default)
    engine: string;

    // Constructor 
    // (accepts a value so you can initialize engine)
    constructor(engine: string) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}  
</pre>
<p>This code creates a Car class that has a constructor that accepts a single parameter <code>engine</code> that initializes the instance property with the same name. so we can write</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
var hondaAccord = new Car('V6');
</pre>
<p>The <code>engine</code> property is defined as being public (public is the default). We could have simply put the public keyword there too. The property could be made private by prefixing the definition with the keyword <code>private</code>. Inside the constructor the <code>engine</code> property is referred to using the <code>this</code> keyword. This code emits this JavaScript:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
// JavaScript
var Car = (function () {
    function Car(engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
    return Car;
})();
</pre>
<h2>Functions</h2>
<p>You can create a function on an instance member of the class, on the prototype, or as a static function. Often you will want to use the prototype for the functions on classes if you intend to create multiple instances of the object. Why? Because the prototype can save you some memory as it only exists once while creating a function on every instance of the class would create 1 function per instance. Creating a function on the prototype is easy in TypeScript, which is great since you don;t even have to know you are using the prototype.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
// TypeScript
class Car {
    engine: string;
    constructor (engine: string) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    start() {
        return "Started " + this.engine;
    }
} 
</pre>
<p>Notice the <code>start</code> function in the TypeScript code. Now look at the emitted JavaScript below, which defines that <code>start</code> function on the prototype.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
// JavaScript
var Car = (function () {
    function Car(engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
    Car.prototype.start = function () {
        return "Started " + this.engine;
    };
    return Car;
})();
</pre>
<p>But if you want to create a function as an instance member, you can do so like this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
// TypeScript
class Car {
    engine: string;
         stop: () =&gt; string;
    constructor (engine: string) {
        this.engine = engine;
        this.stop = () =&gt; "Stopped " + this.engine;
    }

    start() {
        return "Started " + this.engine;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>One way to create a function like this is to do it in the constructor. The emitted JavaScript now shows that the start function is on the prototype and the stop is an instance function. It’s not a great design to mix these, your better off picking one or the other.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
// JavaScript
var Car = (function () {
    function Car(engine) {
        var _this = <span class="hiddenGrammarError" pre="var ">this;
        this</span>.engine = engine;
        this.stop = function () {
            return "Stopped " + _this.engine;
        };
    }
    Car.prototype.start = function () {
        return "Started " + this.engine;
    };
    return Car;
})();
</pre>
<h2>Inheritance</h2>
<p>Class inheritance, as you are probably familiar with it, is not is not something you’d want to hand code in JavaScript. This is an area that TypeScript clearly shines brightly. For example, you can define an <code>Auto</code> class and then define a <code>ManlyTruck</code> class that inherits from <code>Auto</code>. This would provide access to all the public members and the constructor to the <code>ManlyTruck</code> class. It can refer to the base class using the <code>super</code> keyword and it can extend the definition by adding its own members.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
// TypeScript
class Auto {
    engine: string;
    constructor(engine: string) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
} 

class ManlyTruck extends Auto {
	bigTires: bool;
    constructor(engine: string, bigTires: bool) {
        super(engine);
        this.bigTires = bigTires;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>TypeScript emits JavaScript that helps extend the class definitions, using the <code>__extends</code> variable. This helps take care of some of the heavy lifting on the JavaScript side.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
var __extends = this.__extends || function (d, b) {
    function __() { this.constructor = d; }
    __.prototype = b.prototype;
    d.prototype = new __();
};
var Auto = (function () {
    function Auto(engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
    return Auto;
})();
var ManlyTruck = (function (_super) {
    __extends(ManlyTruck, _super);
    function ManlyTruck(engine, bigTires) {
        _super.call(this, engine);
        this.bigTires = bigTires;
    }
    return ManlyTruck;
})(Auto);
</pre>
<h2>Interfaces</h2>
<p>One of the coolest parts of TypeScript is how it allows you to define complex type definitions in the form of interfaces. This is helpful when you have a complex type that you want to use in your application such as an object that contains other properties. For example, we could define an interface for a Car class such that every car must have an engine and a color like this.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
// TypeScript
interface ICar{
    engine: string;
    color: string;
}

class Car implements ICar {
    constructor (public engine: string, public color: string) {
    }
} 
</pre>
<p>The <code>Car</code> class adheres to the interface <code>ICar</code> because it <code>implements</code> <code>ICar</code>. You can use interfaces on classes but you can also use them to define regular variables types. Notice the code below defines the <code>toyotaCamry</code> variable to use the type <code>ICar</code>.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
// TypeScript 
var toyotaCamry : ICar;
</pre>
<p>This <code>Car</code> sample also uses the alternate syntax in the constructor to define that not only are the <code>engine</code> and <code>color</code> parameters being passed to the constructor but they are also defining a public member of the Car class. This is a nice shortcut syntax since you don;t have to define the members nor set them in the constructor: it does this for you, as you can see in the emitted JavaScript.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
// JavaScript
var Car = (function () {
    function Car(engine, color) {
        this.engine = engine;
        this.color = color;
    }
    return Car;
})();
</pre>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>I can see developers who are familiar with Object Oriented Programming (OOP) feeling very comfortable with TypeScript’s classes and interfaces. There is a lot of value here in getting running quickly and feeling secure that you have written solid code. There is so much more that classes and interfaces can do too, as Dan and I show in our TypeScript course at Pluralsight.</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/knockoutjs/uncategorized/2013/01/03/web-sites-using-knockoutjs.html">Web Sites Using Knockout.js</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Lately I’ve been asked a few times to share some companies that are using Knockout.js. While many of the customers I have worked with prefer (or don’t allow) sharing of that type of information. So I asked around and <a href="http://knockmeout.net" target="_blank">Ryan Niemeyer</a> pointed me to <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/knockoutjs/_OjYgdQTwaY/discussion" target="_blank">this google group discussion on the topic</a>. Some were active (after verifying personally) and others were not.  I also did some googling / binging (or bingling if you prefer) and in some google forums found several public sites reportedly using Knockout.js. Since they are all public and I have no affiliation with any of them, I thought I might share. After all, wouldn’t it be nice to have an active list of sites using Knockout?</p>

<blockquote>Disclaimer: I have no affiliation with any of these sites or their companies. Nor do I have any control over whether they choose Knockout or any other library. Obviously, things may change over time too. I am only listing public sites that I was able to verify. I'm not claiming that any company is using Knockout internally.

<p>Before listing them, I went to each site and turned out the developer tools in Chrome and verified that I saw knockout.js being pulled down and in use.</p>

<p>This list took me about 20 minutes to gather and verify. If you have any additional ones you can add to this list, please leave them in the comments. Hopefully with all of your help we can keep this growing.</p>

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Finding errors earlier and more easily is one of the advantages of <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a>. You can use optionally static typed (optionally) variables, functions, objects to help detect possible mismatches in your code right in your editor. Simply add the appropriate type or define an interface for more complex and custom types, and you are off and running! Defining types is by far my favorite feature of TypeScript.

<blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/DanWahlin" target="_blank">Dan Wahlin</a> and I just released a new course for <a href="http://pluralsight.com" target="_blank">Pluralsight</a> that focuses on providing the fundamentals to write application-scale code using TypeScript.

</ul>
<h2>Grammar</h2>
<p>It is easy to decorate your variables with types in TypeScript (see the image above). Start by declaring the variable and naming it (which you already do in JavaScript today). Then use the colon character and a type to indicate that this variable should be of the following type.  For example, the following code shows how you could define a variable in JavaScript which could be of any type. Then it shows how you could tell TypeScript that this variable can only be a specific type (a number). TypeScript builds on the JavaScript type system and uses the keywords number, bool, string, void, any, and null to define basic types. You can also define functions, objects, arrays, and indexers.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
// Standard variable of any type using JavaScript
var age; 

// Typing "age" to a number TypeScript
var age : number; 

// Initializing the variable in TypeScript
var age : number = 99.5; 
</pre>
<p>You may be thinking “Oh great, now I have to change all of my JavaScript to make it work in TypeScript”. Fortunately that’s not the case. The types are optional, so you do not have to type anything if you do not want to. For example, you could simply leave your code without annotating them with types in which case they will be of the TypeScript type <code>any</code>. Both of these examples define customer variable to be of the <code>any</code> type, which is the base type in TypeScript.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
var customer; // inferred to be any

var customer : any;  // inferred to be any
</pre>
<h2>Type Inference</h2>
<p>Let’s say you copy some JavaScript over to TypeScript (put it in a *.ts file). There are no static types defined explicitly yet, however if you start hovering over some of your variables you may start to see tooltips that say your type is known to be a number or string. How can that be? This is where TypeScript uses type inference to figure out what your types are.  In the examples below, the code is valid JavaScript. If you copy that to TypeScript you and hover over the variables you will see that TypeScript is inferring their types based on how they are used! This can help TypeScript figure out if you are using a type incorrectly before you ever run it.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
// num1 is inferred to be number
var num1 = 1; 

// num2 is inferred to be number
var num2 = num1 + 100;

// str1 is inferred to be string
var str1 = num1 + 'some string';

// str2 is inferred to be string
var str2 = num1 + 'some string';
</pre>
<p>Consider this next example where an object literal contains 3 properties. TypeScript is able to determine that the person variable is an object that has 3 properties with specific names and it knows what the type of each property is. It know the <code>name</code> is a string, the <code>age</code> is a number and that <code>getPets</code> is a function that return a string array. Note that all of this is valid JavaScript.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
// person: {name: string, age: number, getPets: () =&gt; string[] }
var person = { 
    name: 'Colleen',
    age: 25,
    getPets: function () {
        return ['Spot', 'Nemo', 'Pascal'];
    }
}
</pre>
<h2>Arrow Functions</h2>
<p>If you have done any work with lambda expressions then arrow function expressions will look familiar. Arrow function expressions are a compact form of function expressions that have a scope of <code>this</code>. You can define an arrow function expression by omitting the <code>function</code> keyword and using the lambda syntax <code>=&gt;</code>. This allows you to write more complex function expressions as callbacks and inline functions more easily. The example below shows a simple function that accepts 2 numbers, multiples them, and return the product. The second function is equivalent, however it uses the arrow function expression syntax.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
var myFunc1 = function (h: number, w: number) {
    return h * w;
};

var myFunc2 = (h: number, w: number) =&gt; h * w;
</pre>
<h2>Value Proposition</h2>
<p>Using a combination of adding explicit static types to your code and using TypeScript’s type inference can help you detect problems as you write the code. The TypeScript editor in Visual Studio 2012 will alert you when it detects a problem and often direct you to the solution. For example, if you pass the wrong arguments into a function it could  tell you that it is expecting something different.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
function getArrayLength(x: string[]) {
    var len = x[0].length;
    return len;
}

var names = ['John', 'Dan', 'Aaron', 'Fritz'];
console.log(getArrayLength(names))

var people = [{name: 'Aaron'}, {name: 'Fritz'}];
console.log(getArrayLength(people))
</pre>
<p>The <code>getArrayLength</code> function below accepts and expects a string array to be passed to it and it will return a number. TypeScript defines this as <code>(x: string[]) =&gt; number</code>. The <code>names</code> variables is indeed a string array, so that will work fine. However the people array is an array of objects. TypeScript will tell you the error “Supplied parameters do not match any signature of call target”. These features alone could have saved me countless hours on several web-based JavaScript applications I have worked on!</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/azure/cleardb/mysql/uncategorized/wordpress/2012/12/28/azurecleardbmysql.html">Tips for WordPress on Azure</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I recently <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/wordpress-on-azure/" target="_blank">posted about how quick and easy it was to set up a WordPress blog on Azure</a>. My blog site has been running for over 3 months on this platform and it really has been great. One of the key reasons I am on Azure is because I have a high confidence in the platform and that if something goes wrong I can recover. So far that’s proved true and if anything, the problems I did encounter have only reinforced my confidence that if something does go wrong that I can recover quickly. Which is ultimately what I care about: not perfection.</p>

<p>I’ve had some ups and downs (let’s call them learning experiences) and I thought I’d share them as I would have loved to know some of this up front.</p>
<h2>Planning for DB Growth</h2>
<p>When you set up WordPress on Azure using the gallery you get a MySQL instance provided by ClearDB.  This is a free MySQL database that ClearDB limits to 20MB and 4 connections. If you believe your database will exceed this amount, which is quite likely since 20MB is pretty small, you can purchase a larger database.  You could cancel the wizard and either choose an existing MySQL database (if a larger one already exists) or go to the Azure Store and purchase another MySQL database service from ClearDB. Then once you get a new MySQL instance, you can run the wizard again and it will appear in your pick list.</p>

<p>Purchasing via the Azure store is quite simple. Choose the New button in the bottom menu and choose Store. Then select ClearDB MySQL Database. 
<a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/azurecleardbmysql/azure-store-1/" rel="attachment wp-att-12591"><img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/azure-store-1-600x392.png" alt="azure store 1" width="600" height="392" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12591" /></a>
You can choose a free instance (limited to 20MB and 4 connections), or a paid instance (1GB or more of space). I chose the “Venus” option which is $9.99/month and provides 1GB of space.
<a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/azurecleardbmysql/azure-store-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-12581"><img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/azure-store-2-600x393.png" alt="azure store 2" width="600" height="393" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12581" /></a></p>
<h2>Upgrading Your DB</h2>
<p>If you already propped up your Azure site with WordPress on the free MySQL database provided by ClearDB, and you need more space, you can upgrade it. The option to upgrade the MySQL database is not currently on the Azure portal, though I suspect that this will be changed in the future because without it folks may go down the path I went, which was painful and frustrating (see my next section). Anyway, you can upgrade your MySQL database, but you have to do it from <a href="http://www.cleardb.com/store/azure/upgrade" target="_blank">ClearDB’s web site</a>. If you do that, then your database can be upgraded in place on Azure, at a cost.</p>
<h2>Recovering From DB Permission Errors</h2>
<p>It would really throw you for a loop if you woke up to errors on your blog like this, wouldn’t it?</p>

<blockquote>WordPress database error: [INSERT,UPDATE command denied to user 'usernameishere'@'ipaddressishere' for table 'wp_options']</blockquote>

<p>I had these all over my blog on Christmas Day (maybe Santa thought I was naughty). What’s wrong? Why is this happening?</p>

<p>Let me back up a bit first … Let’s say you installed your WordPress site on Azure and you didn’t see any messages that said ClearDB was hosting the database and it had a limit of 20MB. Then let’s pretend you start approaching 20MB in your database and you eventually exceed that limit. At that limit ClearDB will automatically remove INSERT and UPDATE permissions from the database tables.</p>

<p>So what’s the problem here? A few things:</p>
<ul><li>The 20MB limit is not displayed anywhere during the wizard process nor on the dashboard. This should be an easy fix.</li>
<li>When you approach this limit ClearDB says they will warn you via email in advance. I received no such emails.</li>
<li>When you hit the limit ClearDB will send another email and will turn off INSERT and UPDATE permissions on your database tables.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you were never shown that there was a 20MB limit (or missed it), you never received an email warning you that you are close, and you never received an email once you hit the limit, then you will likely just see errors everywhere. I spoke to the ClearDB folks and they told me that the warnings are supposed to be sent. I checked my email and my spam and I received nothing from them for some unknown reason. Remember, when this happened I had no idea why this happened. There was no indication of why the INSERT or UPDATE permissions were removed. This took me some good digging around to figure out why it happened. I stumbled across many old posts searching for answers til I was able to guess that the space was the issue. When ClearDB responded to my email, they confirmed that was indeed the problem.</p>
<h2>Suggestions for Azure and ClearDB</h2>
<p>Let me be clear that the problem here are not the products. Azure and MySQL from ClearDB have been excellent for me. The problem is the process. Here are my suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>When approaching the MySQL quota limit, send warnings via email and show them on the Azure portal</li>
<li>When you exceed the limit and the locks are placed, send an email and show a message on the Azure portal</li>
<li>When the limit is exceeded, give me options for fixing the problem (reduce size of DB or upgrade) in the Azure portal</li>
<li>Allow me to upgrade the free DB to a larger one on the Azure portal</li>
<li>When the db size was reduced, the locks were not released after waiting for 30+ minutes. ClearDB says they should have been released within 20 minutes (in an email to me). This should be fixed</li>
</ul>

<p>I later found that I could have upgraded the database through ClearDB, but I did not know that until much surfing of their site later. Regardless, having this in the portal would be ideal and offer an up-sell opportunity.</p>

<p>I realize ClearDB says emails are sent, but since I never received one I cannot assume that safeguard actually works. I believe they think it should be sent, but its worth them having a backup plan to that, I think. I’m fine with them having limits, it’s a business model.</p>
<h2>Upgrading Manually</h2>
<p>There is another option, which is much more manual. I tested this out and it works. However, I first recommend trying to upgrade on ClearDB’s site (unless an upgrade button appears on the Azure portal in the future).</p>
<ol>
<li>Dump the existing database (see section below)</li>
<li>Buy a new MySQL database via the Azure store</li>
<li>Restore to the new database</li>
<li>Link to it in Azure portal</li>
<li>Change your WordPress config file to point to the new database</li>
</ol>
<h2>Backups</h2>
<p>Backup your database and backup your files. Azure is the cloud, not a Xerox copy machine. If something goes wrong you want to have at least 1 backup. I recommend 2 copies: 1 local on your PC and one in another cloud (I use DropBox). Then I also use Carbonite to back up both of those.</p>

<p>There are a few ways you can back up your WordPress site (or any content on Azure). You can FTP to get your files and copy them and you can also one of the many WordPress plug-ins that perform backups for you. Some even backup straight to DropBox for you.</p>

<p>I also like to grab a backup of my database directly. For this I used the tool <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/" target="_blank">mysqldump which comes with the MySQL suite</a>. Once you install MySQL locally you can connect to your remotely hosted database server, grab a backup script, and store it locally. Then you can use this script to restore your database elsewhere. Obviously you will want to test this process out at least once, because you don’t want to wait til you have a failure (if you have one) to try it.</p>
<h2>Scripting a DB with MySQLDump</h2>
<p>Once you grab MySQL you can follow these steps to grab a backup script.</p>
<ol><li>Open a cmd prompt</li>
    <li>Go to <code>C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.5\bin&gt;</code></li>
    <li>Run this command 
<pre class="prettyprint">
mysqldump.exe -e -uYourUserName -pYourPassword 
    -hYourRemoteServer
    yourDatabaseName &gt; c:\localFileName.sql
</pre>
</li>
    <li>The syntax for the mysqldump command is as follows: (-e makes multiple values rows for the insert syntax)
<pre class="prettyprint">
mysqldump.exe -e -u[user] -p[password] 
    -h[host] [database] &gt; [output file]
</pre></li></ol>
<p>This puts a script file on your machine that will generate the schema, permissions, and the data from your MySQL database.</p>
<h2>Generating the Database</h2>
<p>While you can use <code>mysqldump.exe</code> to dump the script file, you can use <code>mysql.exe</code> to generate a database.</p>
<ol><li>Open a cmd prompt</li><li>Go to <code>C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.5\bin&gt;</code></li><li>Run this command&nbsp;(notice that the <code>&lt;</code> arrow points the opposite direction as mysqldump)
<pre class="prettyprint">
mysql.exe -uYourUserName -pYourPassword
    -hYourRemoteServer
    yourNewDatabaseName &lt; c:\localFileName.sql
</pre>
</li><li>The syntax for the mysql command is as follows:
<pre class="prettyprint">
mysql.exe u[user] -p[password]
    -h[host] [database] &lt; [input file]
</pre>
</li></ol>
<p>This process took less than 15 minutes in total from download of the tools, installing MySQL, creating the sql script file, and generating the new database from it. Your mileage may vary, of course.</p>
<h2>Reducing the Database</h2>
<p>You can also remove rows form the database to try to reduce the size. If you can’t use a plug-in to do this because of the INSERT/UPDATE locks in place due to the 20MB limit, you can use a tool like the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/5.2.html" target="_blank">MySQL WorkBench 5.x CE</a>. You can download that tool separately or grab it from the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/" target="_blank">MySQL installation</a>. You can use MySQL WorkBench to access your remote database and run some queries against it to remove unneeded data and reduce the database size.</p>

<blockquote><style color="red">Warning:</style> Do this at your own risk. Editing the database directly could cause irreparable damage to the database. I offer no warranties on this. If you do proceed, backup your database first. I warned you!
</blockquote>

<h5>Remove Spam Comments</h5>
<p>You can remove spam comments in mass using a SQL statement. This is helpful if you get slammed with 10,000+ spam. First, always run your query in <code>SELECT</code> format. This query finds all spam. The key here is that if you wrote the query wrong you may be selecting valid data that you do not want to delete. By using a SELECT first, this helps safeguard you for mistakes that we all make.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT * FROM wp_comments 
    WHERE wp_comments.comment_approved = 'spam';
</pre>
<p>If that query looks appropriate, then you can change it to a <code>DELETE</code> statement, like this.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
DELETE FROM wp_comments WHERE wp_comments.comment_approved = 'spam';
</pre>

<h5>Remove Post Revisions</h5>
<p>As you write posts, WordPress creates revisions for you. If you are like me, you save drafts along the way. If you don;t want these old revisions you can remove them and free up disk space. First run this query to find the old revisions.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
SELECT * FROM wp_posts WHERE post_type = "revision";
</pre>
<p>Then if the query looks right, you can delete them.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
DELETE FROM wp_posts WHERE post_type = "revision";
</pre>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Hopefully some of these tips can help you head of any problems that you may encounter. I’ve been very happy with Azure running WordPress and MySQL so far (been 3+ months). I think as the process improves some of these options may be considerably simpler as they are added to the Azure portal. I don’t know when or if that will happen, but I’ve been very impressed with the rate of positive change that the team has put into place to date, thus I highly recommend giving them a shot.</p>

    <a href="/azure/cleardb/mysql/uncategorized/wordpress/2012/12/28/wordpress-on-azure.html">Propping Up WordPress on Azure</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Recently I moved <a href="http://johnpapa.net" target="_blank">my blog</a> to Azure’s cloud. I had some free credits for <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com" target="_blank">Windows Azure</a> since I have an MSDN subscription, so I figured why not give it a shot. This move meant 3 big changes for me: Microsoft’s Azure platform, <a href="https://www.cleardb.com" target="_blank">ClearDB</a>’s  MySQL services, and making sure I understood the costs in advance.  It has been 3 months and overall I’m thrilled with the platform for my blog. This post will show how quickly you can get a WordPress blog up and running.</p>

<p>Azure does a heckuva lot more than host a web site that uses WordPress. But to keep focused, this post will cover my tips for using Azure for WordPress only. My goals for my blog were simple: I want it to be simple and require very little maintenance on my part to keep it functional.</p>
<h2>Creating a WordPress Site on Azure</h2>
<p>Once you open an account with Windows Azure you can go to their portal to view the buffet of services and products you can purchase. I started by clicking the “New” button in the bottom left hand corner of he screen. This opens a dialog that gives you access to create everything that Azure offers.
<a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/wordpress-on-azure/azure-portal/" rel="attachment wp-att-12171"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12171" alt="azure portal" src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/azure-portal-600x402.png" width="600" height="402" /></a>
Perhaps the easiest way to create a WordPress site is to use their gallery. Once you click the “New” button, choose the “Compute” menu option, then choose “Web Site”, and “From Gallery”.
<a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/wordpress-on-azure/azure-compute-web-site-from-gallery/" rel="attachment wp-att-12191"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12191" alt="azure - compute - web site - from gallery" src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/azure-compute-web-site-from-gallery.png" width="586" height="282" /></a>
A new dialog will open with all of the apps that Azure offers. When it opens (it may take a few seconds) scroll down til you see WordPress. Then click the arrows in the wizard and configure your WordPress site.
<a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/wordpress-on-azure/azure-wizard-1/" rel="attachment wp-att-12271"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12271" alt="azure - wizard 1" src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/azure-wizard-1.png" width="942" height="635" /></a>Notice that it currently uses WordPress v3.4 The latest is now 3.5, so you will want to upgrade once you get it installed. I expect Azure will update this soon too.
<a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/wordpress-on-azure/azure-wizard-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-12281"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12281" alt="azure - wizard 2" src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/azure-wizard-2.png" width="976" height="638" /></a>The url is important here if you don’t want your own domain name. It must be unique, so choose wisely.
<a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/wordpress-on-azure/azure-wizard-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-12291"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12291" alt="azure - wizard 3" src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/azure-wizard-3-600x392.png" width="600" height="392" /></a>
If you see an error message about being over your MySQL quota, you need to cancel the wizard and either choose an existing MySQL database or go to the Azure Store and purchase another MySQL database service from ClearDB. Then, once you get a new MySQL instance, you can run the wizard again and it will appear in your pick list.</p>

<p>Purchasing via the Azure store is quite simple. Choose the New button in the bottom menu and choose <code>Store</code>. Then select <code>ClearDB MySQL Database</code>. You can choose a free instance (limited to 20MB and 4 connections), or a paid instance (1GB or more of space).</p>
<h2>Essential Plug-Ins</h2>
<p>Once you complete the wizard, Azure spins away and launches a blog on your site running WordPress! Then you can add your plug-ins, configure them, and choose a theme. There are tons of plug-ins you can choose from, but I’ll offer a 6 I find very useful:</p>

<h2>Azure Site Options</h2>
<h5>Dashboard and Monitor</h5>
<p>The dashboard view gives you a quick glance at your site, its linked resources (like MySQL databases), your FTP host name, connection strings, options to reset credentials, set up git publishing, and more. It also has a link to your publishing profile, which you can use from Visual Studio. The monitor view shows you stats about CPU time, data usage, requests and errors.</p>
<h5>Configure</h5>
<p>The configure view allows you to add domain names, define connection strings, change your .NET framework or PHP version, and turn on server level settings. I wanted to use my domain name <code>www.johnpapa.net</code> with my blog. This feature was recently added to Azure so it was quite simple to do this. To get there I selected my site <code>johnpapa</code> from the portal.which brought me to my dashboard for the site. Then I clicked the <code>Configure</code> menu option at the top. From here, I clicked the <code>Manage Domains</code> button in the bottom menu and was able to add my domains in there. You simply type in your domain name(s). It also tells you the IP address that you ned to use when configuring your A records with your DNS hosting service. Be sure to do that or the domain won’t be directed here.</p>
<h5>Scale</h5>
<p>The scale view allows you to change from a free to shared to reserved server if you need more power. This is pretty cool on how quickly it migrates everything for you in seconds, in my case. I was quite impressed by this. You can also choose your instance size (how many cores and memory do you need) as well as your instance count. This page as much as anything will dictate your costs. I chose to use the most powerful I could get and still stay within my free instance (using the MSDN Universal promotion).</p>
<h5>Linked Resources</h5>
<p>The final view is the linked resources. This is where you can see other services like the MySQL database that your WordPress blog uses. It is totally not obvious here, but that instance is not hosted by Azure but instead by ClearDB. Not that you really care where it is, as long as it is available. Still, it would be nice to know who to ask for support of it.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Creating the WordPress site was easy. In fact, it was up and running in just a few minutes. As simple as it was, there are a few important notes that I want to reiterate that may or may not be totally obvious.</p>

<p>The MySQL database that you get when you go through the gallery wizard to create the WordPress site has a 20MB limit, though it’s not displayed anywhere during the wizard process nor on the dashboard. When you hit the limit ClearDB will turn off INSERT and UPDATE permissions on your database tables. This will cause terrible errors to show up on your site about permission problems. So the key here is to monitor your database size and keep it in check, or purchase a new larger database for your instance. If you do hit this, please <a href="http://johnpapa.net/azurecleardbmysql" target="_blank">see my follow-up post on tips on how to proactively or reactively fix this</a>.</p>
