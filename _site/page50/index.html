    <a href="/silverlight/2008/10/24/day-of-silverlight-2-recap.html">Day of Silverlight 2 Recap</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Today I went to Tampa and presented a Day of Silverlight 2 with Data Access at the Microsoft office. It was a free event and I like to think everyone was there to see my presentation, but it could also have been because it was free and we gave away a ton of swag including a free MSDN subscription. The people were great, they asked a lot of questions and they genuinely seemed interested in the content.</p>
<p>It was a 3.5 hour presentation on Silverlight 2 data binding, development techniques, using it with SOAP, ASMX, WCF, REST, 3rd party services, cross domain policies, debugging tips, and ADO.NET Data Services. Frankly, we went at warp speed just to cover all of the content. The purpose of the presentation was to demonstrate how Silverlight can be used in business applications. So I covered a lot of ground just to get everyone some exposure to the different areas that they may or may not have thought of.</p>
<p>I promised to post my slides from the presentation on my site, so <a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/downloads/Day of Silverlight 2.pdf">here is a link to the slides for the Day of Silverlight 2</a>. I used these merely as talking points to guide the presentation &hellip; that&rsquo;s my style. I prefer to do that and then show people how things work and answer questions along the way. The group was highly interactive and a whole lot of fun to present to!</p>

<p>If you are in the neighborhood, please stop by. As I am with all of my INETA sponsored stops this year, I’ll be bringing some free swag to give away, too. The session summary is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>   <p>Making the most of the Entity Framework involves first designing a practical Entity Data Model, understanding how to manage the model, and how to effectively interact with it through services. In this presentation I will give a brief overview of the Entity Framework and its related components, demonstrate how to design and manage an Entity Data Model using the designer tools, and walk through examples of how to interact with the model and use tools such as the standard query operators. Demonstrations will include Entity SQL with the Entity Client provider, Entity SQL with Object Services, and LINQ.</p></blockquote>

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>As the cycle for my book is winding down, I have been receiving a lot of requests to get advance copies and/or to review my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596523092/johnpanet-20">Data-Driven </a><a href="/data-services-with-silverlight-2/data-and-services-with-silverlight-2-table-of-contents/">Services with Silverlight 2 book</a>. If I have not responded to your emails or comments, please accept my apologies (I&rsquo;ve been working hard on the book editing process). I figured it&rsquo;s easier to address these questions in a blog post.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are no advance copies of my book. There is no rough cuts, no e-book nor a pre-release version. Doing those things often leads to a lot of changes along the way and it would only get the book in people&rsquo;s hands a few weeks early in my case. The book will be ready in December to pick up in stores.</p>
<p>The good news though is that we will be looking for people to do reviews of the book. If you already emailed me regarding your interest in reviewing the book, I&rsquo;ve put your name on a list. If you have interest in reviewing, please let me know. In a few weeks I will discuss the list with the O&rsquo;Reilly Media and we&rsquo;ll figure out how many review copies we will send out (no promises). So if you are interested and have not contacted me yet, please drop me an email in the next few weeks. All I asked in return for the book is that you write a review on your blog and copy/paste it to Amazon. Pretty good deal :-)</p>
<p>Thank you for all of your interest in the book. I am excited that its getting closer to being in your hands!</p>
<p><font color="#ff0000"><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong></font> If you want to review the book, please use my &ldquo;<a href="/contact/">Contact</a>&rdquo; page send me a message with your name and your desire to review the book. Be sure to enter your correct email address in the form, too, so I can contact you when its time.</p>

    <a href="/silverlight/2008/10/15/data-driven-services-with-silverlight-2-table-of-contents.html">Data-Driven Services with Silverlight 2 - Table of Contents</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>My <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596523092/johnpanet-20">Data-Driven Services with Silverlight 2 book</a> published by <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596523091/">O&rsquo;Reilly Media</a> is almost ready to hit the printing press and is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596523092/johnpanet-20">available on Amazon for pre-order</a> (it should be available in December). I have not published the TOC yet since it has changed a bit along the way. But it is pretty solid now so the Table of Contents for my book is below. I have included all of the chapter titles and a very brief summary of each chapter. There are ton of topics discusse<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596523092/johnpanet-20"><img title="image" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin: 5px 5px 5px 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="282" alt="image" width="220" align="left" border="0" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/DataandServiceswithSilverlight2TableofCo_E624/image_3.png" /></a>d in the book that build up from the data binding chapters and drive deep into using services. The book assumes a basic knowledge of .NET development and XAML as well as Silverlight 2 basics. The style used in the book to present the material is to present the topic, what it does, how it works, when to use it, and then show an example application that demonstrates various techniques and features with Silverlight 2. All code for the book is in VB and C# (thanks to <a href="http://tangiblesoftwaresolutions.com/Product_Details/Instant_VB.htm">Instant VB</a>).</p>
<h3>Chapter 1, &ldquo;Getting Started with Silverlight 2&rdquo;</h3>
<p>This chapter covers the steps required to develop applications with Silverlight 2, and explains the various tools and their purposes. It also examines the fundamentals of Silverlight 2, its control set, and the importance of XAML and its data-binding features, some .NET language enhancements, and includes a primer on XAML as it pertains to data and Silverlight.</p>
<h3>Chapter 2, &ldquo;Silverlight 2 Data-Binding Foundations&rdquo;</h3>
<p>This chapter discusses different ways to use data binding with XAML and with .NET code in Silverlight 2. It examines the controls and provides examples on how to bind custom objects. It also examines the DataContext in depth, as well as situations in which you can apply binding through XAML or .NET code.</p>
<h3>Chapter 3, &ldquo;Modes and Notifications&rdquo;</h3>
<p>This chapter demonstrates situations in which different binding modes can be most beneficial when used with objects and controls. It also explores how to make the Silverlight 2 controls listen for and respond to notifications through INotifyPropertyChanged that can be implemented on objects.</p>
<h3><strong>Chapter 4, &ldquo;Managing Lists, Templates, and Converters&rdquo;</strong></h3>
<p>This chapter explores various techniques for binding and presenting lists of data in list-based controls. It also discusses how to use templates to stylize and present data more efficiently in controls. Examples use LINQ to Objects to query lists of custom entities, converting bound data between the data source and the target controls, and implement notifications for list-based collections using INotifyCollectionChanged and ObservableCollection&lt;T&gt;.</p>
<h3><strong>Chapter 5, &ldquo;WCF, Web Services, and Cross-Domain Policies&rdquo;</strong></h3>
<p>This chapter demonstrates how to communicate between Silverlight 2 applications and WCF services&mdash;both custom and from third parties such as Live Services. It demonstrates how to build an application in Silverlight 2 that communicates with web services on different domains through SOAP using either WCF or ASMX web services. Also, it discusses what cross-domain policies are how to account for them, and how to debug applications using network-sniffing tools.</p>
<h3><strong>Chapter 6, &ldquo;Passing Entities via WCF&rdquo;</strong></h3>
<p>This chapter shows how to send and retrieve custom domain entities filled from ADO.NET-driven data mappers in the middle tier, and expose them through WCF contracts and serialization techniques. It also shows how to pass entities from tools such as LINQ to SQL and from the ADO.NET Entity Framework to and from Silverlight 2 applications.</p>
<h3><strong>Chapter 7, &ldquo;Consuming RESTful Services with WebClient and HttpWebRequest&rdquo;</strong></h3>
<p>This chapter discusses how to consume and present data retrieved from REST services and manipulate it using LINQ to XML. It demonstrates how to use WebClient and HttpWebRequest from Silverlight 2 to invoke RESTful communications with web services, and also includes a primer on RESTful services and how Silverlight 2 can communicate with them.</p>
<h3><strong>Chapter 8, &ldquo;Consuming Amazon&rsquo;s RESTful Services with Silverlight 2&rdquo;</strong></h3>
<p>This chapter demonstrates how to send and receive data using the RESTful API exposed by the Amazon E-Commerce Service (also known as Amazon Associates Web Service). This shows how to build a Silverlight 2 application that allows users to search for and add items to a shopping cart stored at Amazon.</p>
<h3><strong>Chapter 9, &ldquo;Creating RESTful Services and Introducing SilverTwit&rdquo;</strong></h3>
<p>This chapter discusses how to build a RESTful service with which Silverlight 2 applications can communicate. The services allow GETs and POSTs to be sent from Silverlight 2 applications passing XML and JSON. The chapter also demonstrates LINQ to XML and LINQ to JSON, and includes a case study of the SilverTwit Twitter client to demonstrate how building a RESTful WCF application can be an important component of a Silverlight 2 application.</p>
<h3><strong>Chapter 10, &ldquo;Syndication Feeds and Silverlight 2&rdquo;</strong></h3>
<p>This chapter explains issues with consuming syndicated feeds from Silverlight 2 applications and how to overcome them. It also demonstrates the SyndicationFeed class and how to use it to build a robust Silverlight 2 application that uses web services to aggregate Atom and RSS feeds.</p>
<h3><strong>Chapter 11, &ldquo;Silverlight 2 and ADO.NET Data Services&rdquo;</strong></h3>
<p>This chapter demonstrates how ADO.NET Data Services is uniquely qualified to pass data to and from Silverlight 2 applications using REST-style web services. It also shows how ADO.NET Data Services can communicate with and issue LINQ queries against entity data models in a middle tier to save and retrieve data, handle concurrency, batch updates, transactions, implement custom service operations, and design business logic to intercept the LINQ query calls from the Silverlight 2 client.</p>
<h3><strong>Appendices:</strong></h3>
<p>Included in the appendices are some reference materials and a debugging tips and tricks section that describes how to use Fiddler2, Firebug and WebDevelopmentHelper to identify problems.</p>

Technical book writing is certainly a whirlwind tour of writing, coding, and editing. One of the topics that came up was the title and whether or not the term &ldquo;Data Services&rdquo; was confusing since ADO.NET Data Services (formerly known as Astoria) is being referred to by many now as Data Services. Phew, it makes my head hurt. I hate changing titles and frankly the title of a book means very little, but I certainly do not want to mislead readers to think that my book is 100% about Silverlight 2 and ADO.NET Data Services. That is a very important aspect in the book, but there are also other topics like REST, WCF, SOAP, ASMX, LINQ to JSON, data binding, cross domain strategies, syndicated data, and debugging tips. So we decided to change the name of the title to &ldquo;Data-Driven Services with Silverlight 2&rdquo; to make it clearer that the book focuses on dealing with data and dealing with various types of services. Its a minor change, but I think it helps avoid any confusion.</p>
<p>The <a href="/data-services-with-silverlight-2/book-summary-for-data-services-with-silverlight-2-on-amazon-now/">book is due out in December</a> (targeting early December but its out of my control). I will open a page on my site for the book to discuss code samples, updates, and other topics related to the book. It will be directly accessible from <a href="http://www.silverlight-data.com">www.silverlight-data.com</a> too.</p>

    <a href="/silverlight/2008/10/14/silverlight-2-available.html">Silverlight 2 Available!</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Yesterday the announcement came out that Silverlight 2 would be released today and sure enough <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=c22d6a7b-546f-4407-8ef6-d60c8ee221ed&amp;displaylang=en">it is now available to be downloaded</a>. <a href="http://timheuer.com/blog/archive/2008/10/14/silverlight-2-released-officially.aspx">Tim Heuer</a> and <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/10/14/silverlight-2-released.aspx">Scott Guthrie</a> have some great posts explaining what&rsquo;s new, changes between the different versions, and offer some tips and guidance with it. There are tools for using it with Visual Studio 2008 and Expression Blend 2 SP 1 is also out, which support for Silverlight 2. You can find a lot of details on Silverlight 2 from Tim&rsquo;s and Scott&rsquo;s posts &hellip; I suggest reading through those.</p>
<p>The Silverlight team has done a fantastic job in a short amount of time. When you compare what is in Silverlight 1 to Silverlight 2 the difference is astounding. SIlverlight 2 offers so much more its insane. We knew media support would be rich (and it is) but the key aspects to me are all centered around the application centric features. Silverlight 2 has a ton of features that make it a viable option for business applications. IN the upcoming weeks I will be posting some demos, tutorials, and videos and some materials from my upcoming book. Lots to come!</p>

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Today <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/Scottgu/">Scott Guthrie</a> of Microsoft <img title="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; margin: 5px 0px 5px 10px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="181" alt="image" width="164" align="right" border="0" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/ScottGuAnnouncesSilverlight2DueOutTomorr_B590/image_3.png" />announced the release of Silverlight 2 is coming tomorrow, Tuesday October 14th. I&rsquo;ll be updating all of my book&rsquo;s code samples to the Silverlight 2 RTW version. I expect very few issues other than a few styling changes I know of already from&nbsp; Beta 2. There were many good questions after the live conference call today. I paraphrased some of these below.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: For those of you who caught the call too, please let me know if I made any mistakes below &hellip; I was typing like mad while listening. Any typos are purely unintentional.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>What&rsquo;s up for Silverlight 3?
<ul>
<li>No announcements made today on this. But they did say they are very happy with the direction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How do they feel about the current 1 in 4 market penetration of Silverlight?
<ul>
<li>They are very happy about having 1 in 4 with Silverlight 2 just coming out. No earth shattering specifics about how to increase it were announced though.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If a developer has been in another environment his/her whole life, how will Microsoft offer tools for this person to jump over the bridge to develop with Silverlight?
<ul>
<li>They are trying to make the Expression suite an easy jump to people familiar with client development. Visual Studio should be familiar to developers who are expecting similar tooling. Basically, they said they expect one of the 2 should help make the transition for new developers.</li>
<li>Silverlight tooling requires features only in VS 2008. But VS Web Dev Express is free, though.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How is Silverlight 2 helping cross platform development of .NET apps?
<ul>
<li>Trying to gear it to developers who want to build a variety of applications: media rich, data entry, line of business, etc.</li>
<li>New Silverlight controls toolkit is coming out later this quarter. More controls will come after this point, too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Are you going to support mobile?
<ul>
<li>They are committed to bringing Silverlight to mobile devices.</li>
<li>Working with some partners (no specific announcements on this yet)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What are the changes between release candidate RC0 and the final release?
<ul>
<li>RC0 was a developer only release (no Silverlight client available for it).</li>
<li>Purpose of RC0 was to get developers to convert their beta 2 apps to RC0 to be ready for RTW</li>
<li>No API nor behavior changes from RC) to RTW</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Offline support for Silverlight 2?
<ul>
<li>Silverlight 2 supports supports isolated storage and supports cached data on the client</li>
<li>Typically Silverlight 2 focuses on browser apps, which are mostly online</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Will all users of SIlverlight 1.1 be upgraded to Silverlight 2
<ul>
<li>If you are an end user who installed Silverlight, by default they will auto upgrade you to the next release.</li>
<li>They also support a packaged deployment model via WSUS which allows an administrator to control when a new version or patch is deployed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When will full release for Linux be available?
<ul>
<li>Sometime soon, but no roadmap dates</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Any conversations with Apple regarding iPhone or Google with Chrome?
<ul>
<li>They have talked with Apple and are interested in running on the iPhone. They said Apple says today at this time this is not an option (regarding 3rd party plug ins like Silverlight or Flash).</li>
<li>The latest Google Chrome developer release supports Silverlight (the first release had problems with Silverlight).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some of the highlights, from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/oct08/10-13Silverlight2PR.mspx">their press release</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>.NET Framework support with a rich base class library.</b> This is a compatible subset of the full .NET Framework.</li>
<li><b>Powerful built-in controls. </b>These include DataGrid, ListBox, Slider, ScrollViewer, Calendar controls and more.</li>
<li><b>Advanced skinning and templating support.</b> This makes it easy to customize the look and feel of an application.</li>
<li><b>Deep zoom.</b> This enables unparalleled interactivity and navigation of ultrahigh resolution imagery.</li>
<li><b>Comprehensive networking support.</b> Out-of-the-box support allows calling REST, WS*/SOAP, POX, RSS and standard HTTP services, enabling users to create applications that easily integrate with existing back-end systems.</li>
<li><b>Expanded .NET Framework language support.</b> Unlike other runtimes, Silverlight 2 supports a variety of programming languages, including Visual Basic, C#, JavaScript, IronPython and IronRuby, making it easier for developers already familiar with one of these languages to repurpose their existing skill sets.</li>
<li><b>Advanced content protection.</b> This now includes Silverlight DRM, powered by PlayReady, offering robust content protection for connected Silverlight experiences.</li>
<li><b>Improved server scalability and expanded advertiser support.</b> This includes new streaming and progressive download capabilities, superior search engine optimization techniques, and next-generation in-stream advertising support.</li>
<li><b>Vibrant partner ecosystem.</b> Visual Studio Industry Partners such as ComponentOne LLC, Infragistics Inc. and Telerik Inc. are providing products that further enhance developer capabilities when creating Silverlight applications using Visual Studio.</li>
<li><b>Cross-platform and cross-browser support.</b> This includes support for Mac, Windows and Linux in Firefox, Safari and Windows Internet Explorer.</li>
</ul>

    <p>I wrote my Data Points article for the September 2008 issue of MSDN Magazine using Silverlight 2 Beta 2. Since then the RC0 bits have been released, which broke my code for the article. I&rsquo;ve had several requests for the updated code &hellip; and now that my book is winding down I have had some time to go back and fix up the code for this article. Feel free to download the latest bits for the Sep 2008 article titled <a href="/all/service-driven-apps-with-wcf-and-silverlight-2/">Service Driven Apps with WCF and Silverlight 2</a> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/downloads/MSDN Mag - 2008-09.rar">right here</a>.</p>
