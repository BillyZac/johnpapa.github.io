  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>JQuery rocks. JQuery changed the face of the JavaScript and web landscape, and it continues to be awesome today. Angular has a different approach and in some ways I can write my code more efficiently.</p>

<blockquote>I don't subscribe to there being only 1 library/framework. This is not a bash or endorsement of any 1 tool. This is, however, a perspective on how you can code something in JQuery and then in Angular to see the differences.

My presentation was on Progressive Saving with Angular, where you can stash work in progress in local storage and come back to it. It was an abbreviated version of what I present in my <a href="http://jpapa.me/spangz" target="_blank">Pluralsight course Building Apps with Angular and Breeze Part 1</a> and <a href="http://jpapa.me/spangz2" target="_blank">Part 2</a>, where I explore this concept in detail.</p>

<p>You can watch my presentation here.</p>

<p>Here are the slides from my presentation.

<p>And you can <a href="http://jpapa.me/cc-ng-z" target="_blank">run the live demo of the app from this link</a>.</p>

<p>The conference was awesome and very well organized. All of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ngconfvideos?feature=watch" target="_blank">talks from the conference are online</a>. If you pick out a few, be sure to check out the talks by the AngularJS team and my friend <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnXO-i7944M" target="_blank">Dan Wahlin</a>.</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/git/uncategorized/visual%20studio%202013/2014/01/20/its-high-time-to-learn-git.html">It's High Time to Learn Git</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>It’s time. Admit it. You’ve put it off too long and now that Git is tied at the hip to Visual Studio 2013 and there is some great training on it by my friend Esteban Garcia, it’s time to learn it. I use git for all of my code. You can find Esteban’s new course <a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/courses/TableOfContents?courseName=git-visual-studio-developers" target="_blank">Git for Visual Studio 2013 at Pluralsight.</a>
<img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/History.png" alt="History" width="600" height="273" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23321" />
Git has gained a lot of popularity in the last couple of years and I’m seeing more and more developers adopting it.  If you use Visual Studio as your primary IDE, there is a bit of a learning curve to get going and become productive with Git. In this course, my friend Esteban shows you how to get started with Git, the benefits that you get from using it, and takes you through the workflow that you should follow when working effectively with Git.  The course emphasizes being able to perform most Git commands directly from Visual Studio without the need to jump out to command line. And frankly, while CIL is all so popular these days, I much prefer me some GUI!</p>

<p>Team Foundation Server 2013 now gives you the option to select Git as your source control repository, and Esteban spends an entire module covering this functionality.  The TFS 2013 module includes Git commands, associating commits to TFS Work Items, and build automation.</p>

<p>This is a really great course and Esteban does a really good job at thoroughly taking you through the steps that you need to take to be successful with Git while (mostly) staying within Visual Studio.</p>

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>The “best of the best in Angular” will gather later this week in Salt Lake City, Utah for <a href="http://ng-conf.org/" target="_blank">ngConf, according to their web site</a>. <img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ngconf-150x150.png" alt="ngconf" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-23171" />I’m honored to be included as one of the speakers at this all Angular event, along with my good friends <a href="http://twitter.com/danwahlin" target="_blank">Dan Wahlin</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/wardbell" target="_blank">Ward Bell</a>. The event is Thursday and Friday, both of which I hear will be live streamed! This is pretty exciting as the speaker lineup contains some of the most well-known Angular leaders including many from Google Angular team.</p>

<blockquote>To watch the live stream on Jan 16 and 17 I am told you should go to the <a href="http://ng-conf.org/" target="_blank">ngConf web site</a> on Thursday. 
</blockquote>

<p>Check the schedule for the lineup. Most sessions are shorter than normal, which I love. This way they can pack more information in and there is less time for rambling. I’m a huge believer that you do not need an hour+ to get a point across, so my 20 minute session will be very focused</p>

<p>So what am I presenting? I thought about several ideas including structuring my projects, patterns I use, validation logic, but I really wanted to show something that folks might not have seen before. So I settled on showing a cool saving strategy that really plays into a user’s workflow well using Work in Progress (aka WIP). I’ll be presenting to an Indiana Jones themed presentation, whips and all.</p>

<h3>Progressive Saving: Work in Progress</h3>
<p>Quite often we force users to save or cancel data, before moving on when what they really want is to leave the page in a changed state and come back to their work in progress later, perhaps after closing the browser. This requires change tracking, local storage, serializing and rehydrating complex object graphs, not to mention visual indicators to improve the user experience. Come learn how when AngularJS meets BreezeJS we can light up this scenario.</p>

<h3>Other Sessions I'm Excited For</h3>
<p>Dan Wahlin will be presenting a rapid fire version of his getting started session now aptly named Angular in 20-ish minutes. Igor and Brad of the Angular team will be splitting the keynote, which should be awesome. The Google Doubleclick team will be showing how they tackle a large-scale Angular based app. And there is so much more.</p>

<p>This is a new event, but one I think is very timely and I’m excited to be a small part of it!</p>

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>In case you haven’t heard, Durandal is currently running <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/eisenbergeffect/durandal-2014">a Kickstarter</a> to help fund their project in the 2014 year. <a href="http://durandaljs.com/">Durandal</a> is an open source JavaScript library for creating apps with elegant, clean code. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/eisenbergeffect/durandal-2014">Their Kickstarter</a> promises new releases, new and improved tooling, video training courses and a NextGen tech preview.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>By backing the project, you not only help them to achieve their goals, but you can walk away with some nice goodies. For example, if you back at $15 you get the first video training course along with source code. That's a great followup to <a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/courses/TableOfContents?courseName=single-page-apps-jumpstart">my Pluralsight course on Durandal</a>. If you want to pledge more you can get the 2nd and 3rd training courses, early access to the sample app source, early access to tooling and next gen code, t-shirts, virtual conference training, marketing opportunities and more. There's great rewards for individuals, companies and community organizers...plus it helps the project to build a strong foundation for long-term business growth.</p>
<p>The training is an obvious perk of <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/eisenbergeffect/durandal-2014">this campaign</a>, especially since it's being produced by the creator of Durandal. 

<h3>NextGen Preview</h3>
If the Kickstarter is funded, a parallel implementation of Durandal will be produced. Stop what you are doing and <a href="https://vimeo.com/82601948">watch the &quot;hello world&quot; video now</a>. Wow. It's based on emerging web standards, is one of the simplest SPA dev experiences I've seen.</p>

<p>It’s an exciting time to be a developer and Durandal is offering some amazing opportunities. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/eisenbergeffect/durandal-2014">Are you willing to help out?</a> There’s only a few days left.</p>

    <a href="/angular/breeze/javascript/patterns/pluralsight/uncategorized/2014/01/01/building-large-scale-apps-with-angular-and-breeze.html">Building Large Scale Apps with Angular and Breeze</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Angular. Breeze. JavaScript and HTML5. These buzzwords have been getting a lot of air play over the past year. There are plenty of examples to introduce you to these technologies but how do you apply these to larger apps at your workplace? This is where I find an end to end tutorial and demonstration can really help.</p>

<p>One place you can look for a practical implementation is Pluralsight, where they recently published both <a href="http://jpapa.me/spangz" target="_blank">Part 1</a> an <a href="http://jpapa.me/spangz2" target="_blank">Part 2 of my Building Apps with Angular and Breeze</a> courses. These courses intend to serve as a guide to take you from zero to hero to build an app from a blank canvas. Along the way I share my thought process on what I choose to build first, what options I weigh, and how I write code and then refactor it as I go. It is one possible road you can take as there are many ways to build applications, and thus the solution is not what is important but rather the journey getting there.</p>

Recently the Angular team opened up a new way to use <code>$scope</code> with Controllers. So now you can use <code>$scope</code> (what I'll refer to as Classic Controllers) and you can use this (what the Angular team and I refer to as Controller As). I hear a lot of questions about these 2 techniques. Everyone loves choice, but at the same time, most folks like to know clearly what they are getting or giving up with the choices. So let's discuss the two controller constructs in Angular (with <code>$scope</code> and Controller As) and how scope plays in both of these.</p>

    <a href="/angular/durandal/ember/spa/uncategorized/2013/11/30/pageinspa.html">SPA and the Single Page Myth</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>SPA is one of the most exciting technology strategies today, but it may be one of the worst terms in modern web development. Just the word “Page” can have many meanings.</p>
<h3>SPA Misconceptions</h3>
<p>Chances are you have heard the term SPA tossed around at the office. SPA’s are on the rise but there are a lot of misconceptions about what SPA means. SPA stands for Single Page Applications … but are they truly a Single Page App? I’ve found that one of the biggest hurdles for folks understanding SPA is the term itself. The name can often imply that you are building a single page, with a single set of functionality, such as a search screen or a To-Do list app. 
<img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/catspa-300x224.jpg" alt="catspa" width="300" height="224" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-22461" /></p>

<p>Now let’s play out a common scenario where you are a developer and you are making your case for the architecture of your new project to your manager, Bob. You ask for Bob’s permission to build the next mission critical app on a Single Page App strategy. Bob knows the user will see dozens of pages, so Bob might suspect you and the development team that you might be looking for an excuse to use the “latest and greatest” and that it won’t work for multiple pages. “We need more than 1 page” Bob says. We developers tend to gravitate to the shiny new objects. But I don’t think we can blame Bob in this case as the term SPA can easily be misconstrued. You and I both know a SPA is much more than a “single” page, right? Or is it? The answer to that lies in your interpretation of what a “page” is, and that is why I wrote this post :)</p>

<p>Let me be clear: you can build a SPA that supports robust business applications. <a href="http://angularjs.org" target="_blank">Angular</a>, <a href="http://durandaljs.com" target="_blank">Durandal</a>, and <a href="http://emberjs.com/" target="_blank">Ember</a> are three great SPA presentation frameworks that lead the way in this area. So how do we break down this barrier and get the point across that a SPA can fully support large-scale application development? It all starts with understanding the P in SPA. Ask a few developers what a “Page” is, you likely will get a variety of answers. So again, how can we blame Bob for misunderstanding its meaning?</p>

<h3>What's a Page?</h3>
<p>One interpretation of what a page could mean is the “totality of whatever occupies the four walls of the application UI” (a quote from Ward Bell). If that content changes, then we’ve changed to a new “page”. For example, a page switch could be what we do when we switch from Sessions to Speakers in this <a href="http://jpapa.me/cc-ng-z" target="_blank">live demo</a>. That’s a fairly reasonable assumption, but that is not the “page” in a SPA.</p>

<p>The “page” in SPA is the single web page that the server sends to the browser when the application starts. It’s the server rendered HTML that gets everything started. No more, no less. After that initial page load, all of the presentation logic is on the client.</p>

<p>My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/wardbell" target="_blank">Ward Bell</a> defines the server and client roles perfectly here:</p>
<blockquote>The server plays no part in determining what the application does with a SPA. That's the client's job. It's the client that composes application pages out of HTML templates (HTML fragments) and data, both of which it downloads on-demand asynchronously as it needs them.
</blockquote>

<p>The server’s diminished role is an important distinction in a SPA. The server has no UI logic. The server maintains no UI state. The server, however, does provide resources to the client. Those resources start out with the initial HTML for the web page (the shell) and may in response to client HTTP requests for data in the form of HTML fragments, JSON data, or on-demand JavaScript/CSS.</p>

<h3>So Why is it Called Single?</h3>
<p>The single page is the starting point. It’s the first part of the app that gets the ball rolling. When a SPA starts, the first visible thing we notice is the initial server rendering of the shell. That shell is our single page. In many SPA’s we won’t ask for another complete page rendering again. We already have what we need in that initial page rendering and now we rely on the SPA presentation framework to help us orchestrate the HTML changes for the user within the confines of that single initial page.</p>

<p>This is really important. In a SPA, we make one round trip to the server, up front, and get the initial HTML page.</p>

<h3>HTML Fragments are Views</h3>
<p>Let’s revisit our conversation with Bob. You’ve explained to him that the Single Page in SPA is truly just a term that means the first page is rendered from the server, then the client takes over. Bob starts warming up when he hears you say that it’s really a rich web app that can run on any platform, on a variety of devices, and in a modern browser. But Bob is smart, he wants to know how this single page will support the 2 dozen screens your app needs. Bob says “Once we get that initial page loaded, we need other pages, don’t we?” This is where you introduce the term Views.</p>

<p>Views are the “other pages”. The Views are HTML fragments that make up what the users commonly call screens or pages. A user might say “Go to the order entry screen” or “Go to the customer search page”. Their terminology is different from developers, and that’s OK as long as we understand how to translate it when we need to. In our developer speak the term “page” is overloaded. In a SPA everything the users sees is a “view”. When a view occupies the entire screen we call that a page to reflect the fact that it visually commands the user’s full attention. Technically, it’s just a another view composed by the client.</p>

<p>We typically have many views in a SPA. Going back to the <a href="http://jpapa.me/cc-ng-z" target="_blank">live demo</a> you’ll see there are several views. We can flip between speakers, sessions, attendees, speaker details and session details. These views, as we call them, are the answer to Bob’s question. Yes we need other pages. SPA supports that well, we just call them views. That’s an important distinction because we can have more than 1 view visible on the screen at one time.</p>

<p>SPA also supports more than 1 view on the screen at the same time. In the <a href="http://jpapa.me/cc-ng-z" target="_blank">live demo</a> the top navigation and the sidebar are also views. In a dashboard, we can load multiple views, too. So the term views really means an HTML fragment that offers a distinct set of functionality to the application. It often means the view follows the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle" target="_blank">Single Responsibility Principle</a> where the view can operate on its own in a variety of contexts.</p>

<h3>What's the Shell?</h3>
<p>I’ve tossed around the term “shell” without properly introducing it, so let me correct that now. The shell is the layout and structure of your app. The visual parts that rarely change. The shell is generally loaded on the initial page load from the server and serves as the placeholder for all of your views. In the live demo, the shell is what contains the sidebar, the top navigation area, and the content area.</p>

<h3>Navigation and Menus</h3>
<p>Bob now understands the role of views and wants to know how you intend to allow the user to go between the views. Your app will have menus and navigation, so how does a SPA support that? This is where you explain routing.</p>

<p>Most modern SPA presentation frameworks support the concept of routing via a service known as the router. The router’s job is to allow the user to go from View A to View B within the browser by clicking some menu item. if you want to get all technical you can tell Bob about HTML5 push state and the browser’s history and navigation stacks, but it’s probably a more effective route to take (pun intended) to say that the app will have menus, it will support the browsers back and forward buttons, and it will allow a user to go to a specific place (view) in the app given a url (a term known as deep linking) without posting to the server.</p>

<p>When a user clicks on a menu item, the SPA sees that url and translates it to a View that should be displayed. If the view has not been seen before, the application may make an HTTP request to retrieve the HTML template for the view. Then it will compose the view, fill in the template, and display the view in the appropriate location within the shell. If the view has already been viewed once, the browser may have cached it and the router will be smart enough not to make the request. This is one way a SPA can reduce round-tripping to and from a server, and thus improve performance.</p>

<h3>What is Data?</h3>
<p>Another sticking point with SPA’s is how the term data gets tossed around. A SPA requests data over HTTP from a server. Data is not simply a list of customers. Data can be JSON, HTML, or some other resource that the app requires. A SPA can be built to request these resources asynchronously and on-demand. As my friend <a href="http://jesseliberty.com" target="_blank">Jesse Liberty</a> observed:</p>

<blockquote>... there is a big difference in my mind between saying "what is sent from the server to the client may include JavaScript, CSS or even HTML" on the one hand and "only data is sent from the server".</blockquote>

<p>He has a great point. When we think of data, and more importantly when Bob thinks of data, he is likely thinking of the customers and orders in the app. And he is right, but data is not limited to the pure data in a SPA. The data can be anything the SPA client needs from the server. So perhaps this data term is overloaded and we should instead clarify this by saying that a SPA will request resources on-demand (or cache them if so desired) and those resources may be JSON data, HTML fragments, JavaScript or CSS. At least then Bob would clearly know we mean so much more than pure data.</p>

<p>So to clear this up let’s stop calling it data and instead refer to it as resources. A SPA makes requests for resources from the server.</p>

<h3>Worst Name Ever?</h3>
<p>Well, I don’t believe in total absolutes. But while SPA may not be the worst name ever it certainly is not the most clear term to describe them. In fact, I prefer to call them Rich Web Apps but RWA just sounds awful so I’ll stick with SPA :)</p>

<p>PS - Special thanks to Ward Bell and Jesse Liberty for providing their feedback on this post, and for correcting my poor grammar.</p>
