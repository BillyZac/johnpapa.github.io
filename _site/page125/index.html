    <a href="/all/2008/02/01/setting-a-stylesheet-via-dhtml.html">Setting a Stylesheet via DHTML</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Ever wanted to designate a style sheet via DHTML? Well, I hadn't needed to until recently. I have an application that reads an XML data island which tells the page the file name of the style sheet to use. (It could be any file of a hundred files, so I don;t want to load alternate style sheets in this case.) So here is the solution I decided on ...</p>
<p>First ... I created a link tag with an empty href reference. The DOM doesn't store add an item to the document's stylesheet collection unless is has an href attribute.</p>
<p>&lt;FONT color=#006400&gt;&lt;link id="mainStyle" href="" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;</p>
<p>Next, I created some client side javascript that finds locates the mainStyle stylesheet reference and associates it to a specific URL where the stylesheet can be found.</p>
<p>&lt;FONT color=#000080&gt;&lt;script&gt;<br />&lt;!--//<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;document.styleSheets.item("mainStyle").addImport("../css/mystyles.css");&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />//--&gt;<br />&lt;/script&gt;<br /></p>
<p>Of course, I don't hard code the path to the css file. Instead, I read the path from the XML data island and use that. Not much to it, but it does the job. :-)</p>

    <p>If you haven't seen this yet, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/?url=/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/EntLib2.asp">Enterprise Library for .NET 2 has been released this month</a>. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=5A14E870-406B-4F2A-B723-97BA84AE80B5&amp;displaylang=en">Ent Lib 2's download is available</a> as well as some webcasts and PowerPoint presentations that go through the features. Looks like the hands on labs will be coming soon.&nbsp; Even if you never checked out Ent Lib 1.1 for .NET 1.1 you should spend some time looking at the new version for .NET 2. It comes with a series of application blocks that can jump start your application's development. Of course my favorite is the Data Access Application Block but I am also a fan of the Crypto Block, too. :-)&nbsp; I'll be putting an article together for MSDN Mag that should appear later this year on the Data Access App Block in Ent Lib 2, as well.</p>
<p>&lt;IMG alt="Ent Lib 2" src="/photos/jpapa/images/137131/original.aspx" border=0&gt; </p>
<p>This is taken from the Patterns and Practices web site:</p>
<p>&lt;BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style=”MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px”&gt; &lt;P&gt;<span style="COLOR: #000000"><em>Enterprise Library, the collection of reusable and extensible application blocks for enterprise development, has been improved and updated specifically for Visual Studio 2005 and the .NET Framework 2.0 (January 2006)</em></span>&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;</p>

<p>DevExpress has this awesome tool called CodeRush, JetBrains has Resharper and there are a lot of other competitors out there too like JustCode. What I don't get is why the best features from all of these aren't in one package yet. CodeRush has some awesome templetes and the visuals are very good. Resharper has the Find Usages and the pre compilation (which is just #1 in my book). I know thenext versions ar enot out yet, but I have to beleive that these products know they can get a real competititve advantage if they include all of the top used features of each tool in their package. </p>
<p>OK, yeah they are probably already thinking this and I am certainly on board with whoever&nbsp; hits the market with it. But let's go guys :-) The beta released by JetBrains is OK, but it still lacks some of the features to put it over the top. IMO Microsoft has left this market wide open for these companies to take the lead and blow the rest away. Now its just up to whichever company has the ... um ... gumption to do it :-)</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/all/2008/02/01/logmein-remote-control-software-review.html">LogMeIn - Remote Control Software Review</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Lately I have been on a quest to try out the leading remote control software programs. I need something that helps me remotely control my PC, performs well and can let me invite people to watch me demonstrate something on my PC. I've narrows my search down to a few products including:</p>
<ul> <li><a href="http://www.logmein.com">LogMeIn</a><a href="http://www.logmein.com"></a> <li><a href="http://www.gotomypc.com">GoToMyPC</a><a href="http://www.gotomypc.com"></a> <li><a href="http://www.webex.com">WebEx</a><a href="http://www.webex.com"></a></li> <p>While there are other products out there, hey, this is my blog and these are my choices :-)</p> <p>The first product I looked at is LogMeIn. Mostly because this product is the only one of the 3 that still has a <strong>free </strong>version. You can get a free version of LogMeIn that has some scaled down features which basically let you remotely control your PC (sans file transfers). If that suffices for you, then you can stop looking right now as its&nbsp;free, performs fairly well and allows remote control.</p> <p>The LogMeIn Pro version adds a few more features including file transfers and guest invitations. The former allows you to pass files back and forth and the latter allows you to invite another person to either come watch you demonstrate something on your PC or to remotely control your PC while you watch. This latter feature is great for me for a few situations right away: </p> <ol> <li>I often want to show a customer some progress I have made without having to post the code to a web site. <li>It also comes in handy to be able to invite another developer in to help me debug a situation. <li>I can remotely control my PC when I am on the road (this includes full access to email, my file system, and printers).</li> <p>I've used this product for a few days so far and haven;t hit all of the features yet, but so far I have been impressed with its feature set. (All of my remote control tests were done over the Internet.) How does it perform? Well, I was skeptical of this tool mostly because of 2 reasons: I had never heard of it before and its free. Most of the time those 2 combinations add up to a sloppy product. But I have been pleasantly surprised by the features included in LogMeIn as well as the performance. It far out shines the old style remote control programs that repaint screen shots on the screen and kept up fairly well with all of the movements and screen changes I tested. </p> <p>On the downside, I certainly wish I could invite more than 1 person to watch me demonstrate something. As far as I can see they do not offer an upgrade to be able to invite more than 1 person to view my PC at a time. If I am missing something, I will revise this review later.</p> <p>I cannot compare this to the performance of GoToMyPc and WebEx yet as I have not tried them yet. But when I do, I will offer a more extensive comparative analysis. But so far, I have to say that if you look no further than LogMeIn with its free version or even its Pro version of $70/year subscription, IMO you are getting a good value. Even with the cost of its Pro version, LogMeIn is still cheaper than the subscriptions to GoToMyPc and WebEx.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <a href="/all/2008/02/01/interviewing-understanding-the-real-question.html">Interviewing - Understanding the Real Question</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>A week or so ago <a href="/blogs/john.papa/archive/2006/01/22/136993.aspx">I posted some interviewing tips</a> including some do's and some don'ts. Since that post I have had several former colleagues and former employees of mine ask me to post about some of my more unorthodox interview techniques. When I interview a candidate and I think that person has the right stuff technically and in experience, I look for the “other” factors.&nbsp;What “other” factors? … </p>
<p>… Have you ever watched that famous scene from one of the several Robin Hood movies where Robin or one of his merry men (hard not to chuckle here) are taking aim with the arrow and someone says something to the effect of “OK, you can make the shot. But can you do it amidst distractions?”.&nbsp; And then of course he misses the shot when the girl whispers in his ear. My point … don’t let anyone whisper in your ear when shooting an arrow… no no no …. what I mean is that people get all pumped up for interviews. They practice what they say and are comfortable with it. So when I know I like the qualifications but I am unsure how they will perform when under pressure, I try some different techniques.</p>
<p>OK, it is not rocket science … its just a way of finding out how a person is going to handle a late night at the office, figuring out a solution to a problem they have never faced, the production web server crashing or some other work related crisis. Its just another test … nope, it ain’t perfect and it can be beaten, but it certainly has helped me weed out some candidates. Some people are great in all areas until I get to this point in the interview. I start asking them questions that get progressively more difficult to see how the react. Once I get to the point where they don;t know the answer it gives me a lot of insight. Most people get a little nervous (which is fine) at this point and some freeze completely. I have had several people just not answer at all when asked a question they don’t know the answer to. The thing I look for is the people who can handle themselves in a pressure filled situation when the answer is not obvious. Warning signs for me in this situation are:</p>
<ul> <li>the person won’t let us move on until they find the right answer (sometimes they will wait forever unless I make them move on to the next question) </li><li>yelling (yup, I had a guy just start yelling out answers. he wasn’t mad, I don;t think, just nervous yelling) </li><li>sudden case of the BS (this is never good … never lie … never never never!)</li></ul>
<p>What I am really looking for is:</p>
<ul> <li>simply a brief “I don’t know” </li><li>even better answer is “I can find out by doing XYZ” </li><li>calm demeanor </li><li>thinking out loud … considering possible options</li></ul>
<p>The key here is to realize that sometimes the question verbalized is not the question that you are answering. In this example I don’t care if the person knows the 7 layers of networking in order or the definition of 3rd normal form … what I care about is seeing how they respond to pressure. I want to hire people&nbsp;who can solve problems, not people who have memorized syntax or text books. People who can work with others by identifying a problem and going a step further and offering a few solutions and making a recommendation.</p>
<p>I always ask the questions calmly, professionally and always let the person go with it where they will. I really let them drive the conversation to see where they take it. I don’t do this very often as I only call upon this technique when I think I have a winner but I just need to see how they will do under pressure. In fact, some of the best people I have hired were the worst resumes that got in the interview door but just had the “IT” factor. This technique helped show me that these people could handle pressure and a lot of them really blossomed into great developers, business analysts, and managers. </p>
<p>Do I know what I am talking about? Eh, who knows. It has worked for me. Just something to consider when interviewing … always relax and be yourself and you’ll be a step ahead.</p>

    <a href="/all/2008/02/01/interviewing-tips.html">Interviewing Tips</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I’ve been on many interviews and (in my past) as a manager and VP of Technology I’ve interviewed more people than I can count. I thought I would share some of my interview experiences from the manager side with you. I have a particular style when I interview people and its a bit odd to some. You see, I look for the right fit. First, to get in the room with me for an interview I look for the basic technology skills.&nbsp;If I am hiring for a particular job I look for the person to have most of the skills on his./her resume with some work experience to back it up. After that, I leave it up to the person to sell themselves to me.</p>
<p>The job interview is process is a 2 way street. You are looking for a job and the employer is looking for an employee to hire. You both need to interview each other. So many people go into the interview with 1 or the other in mind. You should not go into an interview with the thought that you just want to get the job. It shows a lot to an employer when you show that you want to know more about the company and your role in it. It shows that you have interests and motivations and that you truly care about where you work.&nbsp;When I hire people, I want&nbsp;people who want to be here. </p>
<p>But you also shouldn’t go into an interview thinking that you are the one interviewing the company. (Even if it is true in your mind.) Walking in the door and having an attitude that your questions are more important or that you are more important is a great way to not get the job. OK, you might think this does not happen but I have witnessed several different people walk into interviews and act like they are too good for the job … have an attitude of “what can you offer me?” right off the bat. Even if the candidate is the most technically qualified, I won’t hire them if they have a “me first” attitude. Been there, done that, made that mistake. Even when you KNOW you are over qualified, show confidence, not arrogance. It is a fine line but if you can walk it you can write your own ticket. When you know you have the skills they need, always show interest in the interviewer. Make eye contact. Listen to everything they say (not just hear it, but listen). </p>
<p>I’ve interviewed people who knew their stuff backwards and forwards but then blew it because they talked trash about their old company, talked trash about their colleagues, talked trash about coding in any way but a particular way … basically, some of the people were so rigid and stuck in their ways that it gave me great concerns about their ability to fit into the company’s style. Now I am not saying lie. Never do that. If you firmly believe a coding style is poor, then say so. But say it professionally. And for goodness sake, don;t ever disrespect anyone in an interview … not your former employer, not your colleagues, nobody! Even if it is funny and makes the interviewer laugh you are showing disrespect and are giving the person a reason to think “hmmmm … is this person going to be loyal?”. Negativity is not a good thing.</p>
<p>OK, what should you do?</p>
<ul> <li>Don’t put something on your resume unless you know it. No excuses. This is a huge red flag. never do it. Never. Did you hear me? Never! </li><li>Make eye contact (no, don’t stare even if the person is cute). Seriously, eye contact shows confidence, interest and a hundred other great qualities. Do it. </li><li>Ask questions. Candidates who don't ask questions make interviewers have to guess if you are interested. </li><li>Ask questions at the appropriate time. Yeah, don’t go crazy with asking questions … but do it when asked if you have any. </li><li>Always answer questions. If&nbsp; you don't know the answer, then say that. Don’t think about it in the interview for 10 minutes. Yes, I have seen this repeatedly. You’d be amazed at how many people will sit there and try to think of an answer to a question for an eternity. If you do not know, that’s OK. Say you don;t know but follow up with how you would figure it out. </li><li>Know how to solve a problem. The answer is important, yes. But knowing how to get to the answer is more important. It shows you can think on your feet as opposed to showing you know a particular factoid. I want people to work with me that can solve problems, whatever they may be. Once of the best hires I ever made was to a guy who knew very little about programming but he was excellent at working with people and knew he could figure anything out quickly. These people are golden. I hire them instantly. </li><li>Be comfortable. Very important to relax. This is your potential job where you will spend a ton of your time. Yeah its important, but do you think they want to hire someone who can’t handle pressure? Chill out, relax, wear comfortable clothes, and just relax. </li><li>Be honest. Don’t guess at questions. If you blow smoke, someone will catch you. </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a lot more to keep in mind but in short … be honest, relax and show that you are a likeable person. (Hey, you can use those 3 tips on a date too).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/sstewart/default.aspx">Scott Stewart</a> <a href="http://www.dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/sstewart/archive/2005/09/25/132927.aspx">relives his most recent experience with customer service</a>. Scott's is only one experience, but it makes you wonder why customer service in general ever responds&nbsp;like he says they did to him. In short, Scott's blog relives an experience where he brought a laptop to a store where he had an appointment with their customer service to look over why the laptop was so hot. The guy basically said they had to ship it out. According to Scott's post, the customer service guy wouldn't try to listen to the symptoms, wouldn't try to swap out hardware pieces to see if they could figure out what part was the culprit, and wouldn't even talk to him. You can read the entire experience on his blog which he calls <a href="http://www.dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/sstewart/archive/2005/09/25/132927.aspx">iExpectedMore</a>.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: OK ... this post is not about any specific company but rather about what customer service should be. Any scenarios contained within are ficticious and meant to drive home the point.</em></p>
<p>Think about those software vendors out there that let you buy a product, try it out and if you do not like it, you can return the license and get your money back within a certain time frame. Or the electronic stores that have the same no risk no hassle policy! What a concept!&nbsp; That instantly draws me to try it out and even if I do not like the product, I will consider that company in the future. It is good customer service! (Yes, those words can be in the same sentence)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;FONT face="Courier New" size=2&gt;if (customerServiceAgent.Listen == false)</p>
<p>&lt;FONT face="Courier New" size=2&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;customer.LikelihoodToBuyAgain == false;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;rant&gt;</p>
<p>... This is a HUGE frustration point of mine ... </p>
<p>OK, forget Apple for a minute ... just consider customer service in a broader sense. What do you really want when you have a problem with your widget? First and foremost they want it fixed. That was easy, but et's go deeper since most issues can;t just be fixed with magic pixie dust. People generally want to talk to a live person, who is&nbsp;educated on the matter,&nbsp;promptly available and listens to what you have to say. For example, I don;t want to call customer service about my widget and have to wait an hour to get to a person only to transfer to another person because they don;t know enough about my widget to help me. I also don;t want to hear that I should send it in before they even listen to what is wrong. </p>
<p>Here is a major point that customer service departments should all get, but they don't: <strong>Customer service is about the customer</strong>. Why is this so hard to understand? When the customer contacts customer service the customer wants to hear "I'll take care of it". That simple phrase defuses the situation in most cases. Listen to the customer's issues, let them get their frustration out and tell them you will find the answer. You don;t have to find it then and there, that's not my point. You very well may have to ship the product away to get it fixed, but that is not a reason to tick off your customer by not even letting them tell you about the issue. Think about this for a second ... if you have a broken computer you are frustrated. You want to tell someone about it. It helps blow off the frustration. When a customer service agent listens to this and says here is what we're going to do to solve this you think 'geez, s/he is going to help me get this solved'. You feel better. You want to work with the company again. The customer experience should be enjoyable.</p>
<ol> <li>Returns should be easy with no hassle <li>Customer service should listen <li>If products get shipped away, replacements should be available (temporarily or permanently)</li> <p>Yes, customer service costs money. But it buys my loyalty and my future dollars.</p> <p>&lt;/rant&gt;</p>

    <p>&lt;FONT face=Tahoma size=2&gt;I just confirmed that I’ll be presenting a full day workshop at <a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2006/orlando/">&lt;FONT face=Tahoma size=2&gt;VSLive in Orlando in May 2006</a>&lt;FONT face=Tahoma size=2&gt;&nbsp;<a href="/blogs/john.papa/archive/2006/02/01/137413.aspx">in addition to a regular 1 hour session </a>titled <a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2006/orlando/smart-sessions.aspx#exploitingsystem">&lt;FONT face=Tahoma size=2&gt;Exploiting System.Transactions and ADO.NET 2 </a></p>
