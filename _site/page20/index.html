    <p>VSLive, Pluralsight WebCast and the inaugural Tampa Windows Developer User Group. That’s all that’s left for me this year for presentations. Actually, it’s a pretty full plate given that the year is almost up and the holidays are upon us. Here is my remaining 2011 schedule:</p>
<p><strong>Tampa Bay WinDev: Intro to Metro UI</strong> </p>
<p>(Nov 30 at 6pm ET)</p>
<p>This is the first meeting of the new Windows user group hosted at the Microsoft offices in Tampa. This will be a run through of the Metro app dev landscape. <a href="http://tbwindev11.eventbrite.com/">You can register here</a> for this Nov 30 event.</p>
<p><strong>Pluralsight WebCast: Windows 8 Metro App Development </strong></p>
<p>(Dec 5th at 4pm ET)</p>
<p>This is a <a href="http://www.pluralsight-training.net/">Pluralsight</a> hosted live web cast with both <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/dwahlin/">Dan Wahlin</a> and I talking about our new Windows 8 course and answering your questions. <a href="http://www.pluralsight-training.net/microsoft/Webcasts">The web site has the wrong date and time, it is indeed Dec 5th at 4pm ET.</a></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://vslive.com/events/orlando-2011/tracks/track-list.aspx">VSLive Orlando</a>: JavaScript Patterns for HTML5 </strong></p>
<p>(Dec 7th at 9:15am ET)</p>
<p>JavaScript gets a bad rap sometimes for easily confused global variables, script files that are thousands of lines long, and mixing html with script code. But it doesn't have to be that way. This session will demonstrate common techniques to separate structure (HTML), behavior (JavaScript) and presentation (CSS) with modern Web development. I'll offer a few tips to make your JavaScript more maintainable, manage namespacing, and demonstrate how to implement various JavaScript patterns.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://vslive.com/events/orlando-2011/tracks/track-list.aspx">VSLive Orlando</a>: </strong><strong>Advanced Patterns with MVVM in Silverlight and Windows Phone 7 </strong></p>
<p>(Dec 7th at 1:30pm ET)<br />Ever wonder what the MVVM pattern is, why it exists, when it works well, and what parts you may want to use or not use? In this session I'll discuss all of these topics and go through important scenarios including messaging, child windows, testing with design timed data, tombstoning, dialogs, and how to apply these principals to both Silverlight desktop and Windows Phone 7 applications.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://vslive.com/events/orlando-2011/tracks/track-list.aspx">VSLive Orlando</a>: </strong><strong>Data Binding and MVVM Patterns in HTML5</strong></p>
<p>(Dec 8th at 3:00pm ET)<br /></p>
<p>There are several ways to push and pull data in and out of HTML elements, each with their own advantages. In this session we’ll examine some common techniques to present data in the UI including loading JSON data in and out of HTML elements using jQuery, presentation through&nbsp; templates. We’ll also demonstrate how to apply data binding using the MVVM pattern in our JavaScript </p>

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I love data, data binding and development patterns. So it should be no surprise that my next course to be released with Pluralsight is on <a href="http://www.KnockoutJS.com">KnockoutJS</a>. I recently released an <a href="http://jpapa.me/Win8IntroPS">Introduction to Building Windows 8 Metro Applications</a> course with my good friend <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/dwahlin/">Dan Wahlin</a> for <a href="http://www.pluralsight-training.net/microsoft/">Pluralsight</a>. Thanks to all of you who have been watching it! I’ve been asked what else is on my list for Pluralsight videos, so I thought I might share my current plans. </p>
<p>I’ve got several other ideas for courses that I’ve been working on and the one that will be released next will be a course on using JavaScript to build MVVM apps with KnockoutJS. I’m been a big fan of MVVM, separation of concerns (SoC) and structured programming, so <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout</a> really is a great fit for my style. If you have not used Knockout yet, I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised on how powerful and easy it can be to create rich HTML5 apps using JavaScript. It’s ideal for using the MVVM pattern with JavaScript and getting the benefits of data binding, templating, and SoC. I'm using KO 1.3rc for now which seems pretty solid and soon will become the official 1.3 version of the library.</p>
<p>The course is currently targeted for the beginning of February 2012, mostly because the holidays are between me and the target date. But I am hoping to finish early.</p>
<p>After that, I’ve had a lot of interest in a course using MVVM with XAML. If the interest still holds true, I’ll be sure to put that together as well. Bottom line is that if you want a new course, be sure to <a href="http://support.pluralsight.com/forums/127919-new-course-suggestions">vote for it on the Pluralsight voting page</a> (a new feature on their site). You can <a href="http://support.pluralsight.com/forums/127919-new-course-suggestions/suggestions/2391339-knockout-js">vote for KnockoutJS</a> here already, vote for another course, or add your own for MVVM or any other topic. </p>
<p><a href="http://support.pluralsight.com/forums/127919-new-course-suggestions/suggestions/2391339-knockout-js"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/VSLive_9387/image_3.png" width="506" height="141" /></a></p>
<p>What else? I have a few others I am mulling, but I don’t want to get too far ahead of myself yet. I’m doing a lot of work with Entity Framework Code First, <a href="https://github.com/BorisMoore/jsrender">JsRender</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BorisMoore/jsviews">JsViews</a>, and more … but I don’t think I’ll lean towards full courses on those. In fact, I have something else in mind for those topics where I might do some tips and tricks or more specialized courses. at this point, nothing is concrete. My first goal is to get Knockout knocked out <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/VSLive_9387/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png" /></p>

    <p>OK, so maybe not “dating” Twitter, but at least using it and getting some bang for your buck.&nbsp; Tools change. For a while it was training classes and books, then it evolved into “googling” for answers, blogs became really important, and then came Twitter. Something else will surely follow, but for the “right now”, Twitter is an immensely helpful tool when used wisely. </p>
<p>This week I wrote <a href="http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2011/11/14/getting-the-most-out-of-twitter.aspx">5 tips on how to get the most out of Twitter for my Papa’s Perspective column. Check it out</a>.</p>

    <p>I’ve been writing again after what amounted to a 2+ year break. In the past 3 months I’ve written 10+ articles, many of which are published for Visual Studio Magazine in my <a href="/papa-rsquo-s-perspective-debuts">new 1 page editorial column Papa’s Perspective</a>. I’m enjoying the column so far as I get to write about a variety of technologies and burning hot topics, all from my view in the cheap seats.</p>

<p><a href="http://jpapa.me/PapasPerspective"><img class="alignnone" style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="pp" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/Papas-Perspective_124F2/pp_7.png" alt="pp" width="604" height="153" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>The deal is that I write 1 article for the print magazine of Visual Studio Magazine each month and I write 2 for the online magazine. They all end up online, which is cool since I can link and share them all.</p>

<p>Again, I love that they are 1 page articles … makes it a 5 minute time investment for you and for me, it makes it more important to get right to the point and cut the fluff. In case you have not gotten a chance to read them yet, here are the 9 that are out so far (in order of most recent first).</p>

<p>I am happy to announce that my first course with <a href="http://www.pluralsight-training.net">Pluralsight</a> is now available. I partnered on this course with my friend <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/dwahlin/default.aspx">Dan Wahlin</a>, who is a top notch instructor/presenter. Together we decided to create a course that helps developers get familiar with what Windows 8 Metro Style apps have to offer, from both a XAML and HTML perspective. So even if you have zero experience with Metro apps, this course is a good primer.</p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/ebb2b43c4728_59A/image_2.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: left; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/ebb2b43c4728_59A/image_thumb.png" width="112" height="101" align="left" border="0" /></a><a href="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/ebb2b43c4728_59A/image_4.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/ebb2b43c4728_59A/image_thumb_1.png" width="113" height="102" align="right" border="0" /></a>And to show they have a sense of humor, the folks at Pluralsight used a tracing of our photos on their web page that makes us look, let’s say, a little cartoonish <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-style: none;" alt="Smile" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/ebb2b43c4728_59A/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png" /> .</p>

<p>So if you are itching to get going with Windows 8 development and have put it off, be sure to <a href="http://jpapa.me/Win8IntroPS">check the full course out online at Pluralsight</a>. Here is a sample video from the module that I think shows how Metro style apps using XAML offer both a very familiar development experience for XAML devs and some new features that are pretty cool.</p>

  <div>
    
    
    <p><strong>Short version: </strong></p>

<p>My family and I are moving back to Florida, I’m leaving Microsoft, heading to Disney World, and we’re doing it to be near family. I’ll still be VERY active in the community and hopefully with Microsoft <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-style: none;" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/All-Good-Things-_C24D/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png" alt="Smile" /><a href="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/All-Good-Things-_C24D/Mickey_logo_32074709_500w_2.jpg"><img style="display: inline; float: left;" title="Mickey_logo_32074709_500w" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/All-Good-Things-_C24D/Mickey_logo_32074709_500w_thumb.jpg" alt="Mickey_logo_32074709_500w" width="240" height="160" align="left" /></a></p>

<p><strong>What’s up next?</strong></p>

<p>I’ll be working for Disney, but also writing articles for Visual Studio Magazine, doing videos, hosting some shows (TBA), and speaking at events. Wanna stay in touch with me? Follow me on Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/john_papa">@john_papa</a></p>

<p><strong>Longer version … </strong>(with a bit of a rambling)</p>

<p>It’s only been 2 years for me at Microsoft, but man it’s been a great 2 years! The day I started in Developer Platform Evangelism (DPE) I was thrown into the fire and it’s been a whirlwind since … but that’s also why I love being an evangelist. Where else can you be involved in multi-billion dollar products used around the world, speak in keynotes, host channel 9 shows, and get to work with icons in our industry? And with Build behind us and the excitement around Windows 8 just beginning, it’s a difficult time for me to leave … but it’s what I feel is best for my family.</p>

<p>We’ve decided to make the move back east to Florida to be closer to our extended family and have our kids grow up surrounded by them, as my wife and I did. This was a difficult decision to leave Microsoft as I’ve truly enjoyed the past few years working at the “mother-ship”. My last day is Monday Sep 19<sup>th</sup>, my family packs up the same day, and we fly to Florida on Friday. We’ll be living near Orlando and I’ve accepted a position working for Disney World as a technical leader in their Center of Excellence team. Disney is allowing me to continue my community presence, which was absolutely essential for me. I’m just too social and bleeding edge not to stay connected <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-style: none;" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/All-Good-Things-_C24D/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png" alt="Smile" />  I’ll still be out there as I was before, during, and now post Microsoft doing the consulting/speaking/writing circuit.  Evangelism is in my blood.</p>

<p>I worked with a great team of folks, but I’d be remiss if I did not single out my boss (and skip bosses) Tim Sneath, Neil Hutson and Neil Leslie. They gave me the opportunities to succeed and I owe a lot to them. Great folks indeed.</p>

<p>Whenever you change jobs its nice to reflect to see if what you did had an impact. I like to think I did … and I certainly am very thankful that I took the plunge of moving out west for the past 2 years. No regrets whatsoever.</p>

<p>The decision to move to Seattle to work for Microsoft was a difficult one that my family and I took. But we felt that the career opportunity was just so awesome … and I absolutely have fond memories of my short but jam packed 2 years in Redmond. I spoke at 2 MIX events, 2 PDC’s, Build, Tech Ed, and several other conferences. In fact, in my first week at Microsoft I was asked to prep a 60+ page whitepaper about Silverlight 4, prep 2 demos for the keynote, and prepare a 400 level presentation for PDC, which was in 3 weeks. It was tough, just moving to a new city, but man it was a blast! Thankfully I had some great team members like Adam Kinney (who also became a very dear friend) who were there to lend a hand while I got my feet wet.</p>

<p>I soon found that just a week after PDC 2009 that planning had begun for MIX 2010 (at least my involvement). I am sure the event team led by Jennifer Ritzinger and Mike Swanson had been working on it for months already. There always seems to be something new to focus on, something with large impact, something to really immerse yourself in. That’s why I enjoyed it so much … always something new and a feeling that what I did could potentially have a positive impact.</p>

<p>I was track chair for the MIX events, hosted pre conference sessions, helped organize influencer events such as the MIXers and the Open Source Fest, prepared keynote demos (ex: ebay), spoke in a few keynotes, hosted community and partner interactions, got to work with amazingly brilliant people, and made several lifelong friends. I also had the pleasure of spending 6 months of deep planning while spearheading the Silverlight Firestarter event which had tens of thousand of people viewing it live. (Tons of folks went into this great event too of course, led by John Allwright and Raman Kohli.)</p>

<p>I got to work closely with the engineering groups too, most notably the Silverlight team, the Phone team, the Windows 8 dev teams, and the RIA Services teams. Hundreds of brilliant folks who were fantastic to work with. As a community leader, I was honored to be able to work very closely with and manage some groups such as the Silverlight insiders, RDs, and various MVP groups. Our community is a strength and is a tremendous asset to helping provide feedback to the product teams on the products created at Microsoft. I hope to go back to being one of those external influencers, myself.</p>

<p>The highlight of working at Microsoft was getting to know all the great people including Scott Guthrie. I had a chance to prepare and speak with Scott in a few keynotes. He’s an amazingly brilliant man who manages to juggle a lot of tasks. But the thing that impresses me most of all is that when Scott talks with people, he always concentrates his full attention on them. You know he has a ton going on, but he somehow shuts it out and gives people his focus … and I’ve seen him do it with customers and co workers, regardless of stature.</p>

<p>I also recall a little idea that my colleague Yochay Kiriaty (thanks man!) and I chatted about when I first got to Microsoft about a weekly Silverlight and Phone based video series that turned into 83 episodes and over 4 million views of <a href="http://silverlight.tv">Silverlight TV</a>. And for most of this year I was immersed in Windows 8 XAML and HTML/Javascript … which has been thrilling. I was glad I was able to present a topic at Build, especially since this was my last week. I plan on doing much much more with Windows 8 in the near future … it really is an exciting time to be in our industry. I’ll leave more about Windows 8 for some future posts as I have a lot planned. You should be hearing more about Windows 8 from me at the upcoming events I’ll be speaking at, some videos I’ll be producing, and my new <a href="http://visualstudiomagazine.com/Home.aspx">magazine columns</a> (yes, there will be another one I should be able to announce soon too). I’m also working on some other exciting ways to share and interact with the community (hush for now).</p>

<p>But it is all about family … and my family is ultimately first on my list of priorities. We’ve felt detached from our extended family these past few years. I have 4 sisters, 15 nieces/nephews, am the youngest of 40+ grandchildren (I lose count), and have more family members than I can recall. All The vast majority of them live in NY and Florida. By moving back east we can see them more often and have our kids grow up living the family values that my wife and I both grew up with. My father, who is my best friend, lives in in Florida (as do my in laws, some uncles/aunts, cousins, etc) too. We lost my mother a few years ago to cancer and this year we lost several family members to time. No more regrets … the time is now … we’re heading back so we can enjoy the time we are blessed with.</p>

<p>Why Disney? Well, anyone who knows me well knows that my family and I are just crazy about Disney. We love spending time there, love the customer service, and I already was familiar with the team I will be working with since I consulted with them a few years back. In fact, my new manager is a former Microsoft employee too. I’m looking forward to jumping in, and who knows, maybe I’ll cross train with  Goofy … though the idea of hanging with Captain Jack Sparrow makes me light up <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-style: none;" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/All-Good-Things-_C24D/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png" alt="Smile" />. As part of their Center of Excellence (COE) team I’ll be able to stay with leading technology and influence the next wave of technology at Disney. There is a lot going on at Disney and I am very excited to have an opportunity to contribute and have a positive influence there.</p>

<p>If you are ever in the Disney World neighborhood, look me up.</p>
