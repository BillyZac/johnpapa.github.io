    <p>Today I saw the first copies of my book in print, hot off the presses. So where can you get it? </p>
<ul>   <li>You can <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596523091/">purchase the ebook today from O’Reilly’s site</a> </li>    <li>You can buy the <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596523091/">print version of the book also from O’Reilly’s site</a> </li>    <li>You can <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596523092/johnpanet-20">purchase it from Amazon</a>, who will be receiving my book in the next few days (obviously O’Reilly gets it first) </li> </ul>

Of course, code samples will be available from <a href="http://www.silverlight-data.com">www.silverlight-data.com</a>&#160; and from O’Reilly’s site, too.</p>
<p>For now, you can find the code samples for the book in my&#160; l<img title="image" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; border-right-width: 0px" height="180" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/NowAvailableDataDrivenServiceswithSilver_C7C9/image_8.png" width="260" align="right" border="0" />inks section.

    <a href="/all/2008/12/17/early-peek-at-resharper-4-5-features.html">Early Peek at Resharper 4.5 Features</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>From the JetBrains web site I grabbed this info below that explains the latest features that the next release of Resharper should have. I love this tool, personally. I’ve tried many refactoring tools and this is the only one that does not get in my way, is easy enough to learn, and offers me a big productivity boost. Now obviously everyone is different in how they like to code … some don’t&#160; like these tools at all, and some like others tools like Refactor Pro and Code Rush. Those are nice tools too, in fact I love their templates and their eye candy visuals. Its a great competition between these 2 tools, I love revisiting it each year and seeing who is better for me. R# has some great features for refactoring XAML in WPF and Silverlight too.</p>
<blockquote>   <p><img title="image" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="93" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/EarlyPeekatResharper4.5Features_130B1/image_3.png" width="106" align="left" border="0" />We're boosting performance in version 4.5 – ReSharper will feel like it's been turbocharged! </p>    <p>We are also unveiling a fascinating feature that deserves a special mention: Solution-Wide Analysis. In addition to the current abilities to detect errors in your entire solution, ReSharper 4.5 enables you to identify unused code, excessive access rights, overly specific types and such on. </p>    <p>Other feature highlights of ReSharper 4.5 include: </p>    <ul>     <li>Better Visual Basic support: our cross-language refactorings and editing experience enhancements will better support VB code </li>      <li>New refactorings </li>      <li>Enhanced setup for naming conventions, which will be supported by all ReSharper features </li>      <li>Multiple new productivity enhancements </li>   </ul>    <p>We expect first public builds of ReSharper 4.5 to be available by the end of the year, Q1'2009 bringing the release. And the upgrade will be free for ReSharper 4.0 customers. </p></blockquote>

    <p>Today was supposed to be the geekSpeek webcast for my ADO.NET Data Services and Silverlight topic …. however … life took a detour. <img title="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; margin: 5px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="193" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/WhenLifeTakesaDetour_F0E4/image_6.png" width="200" align="left" border="0" /> </p>
<p>This morning my family had a little scare and I had to rush to the hospital when my unborn son decided to shake things up a bit. Both mom and the baby are doing fine after hours&#160; and yes we convinced him to stay inside for what we hope is another 11 weeks when she is due. We were very touched by all of he emails, text messages and tweets we received from so many people today. Thank you all very much for the thoughts, kind words and prayers.</p>
<p>Back off the detour … I apologize for the postponement of the geekSpeek webcast and I appreciate your patience as we rescheduled it to January 8th, at 3pm EST (12 PT). The topic will be using ADO.NET Data Services from Silverlight, one of my favorite topics :) Come for the great topic, conversation and demos! This is a great chance to hear about some of the topics from my book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596523092/johnpanet-20">Data-Driven Services with Silverlight 2</a>.</p>

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Last week I presented several sessions at <a href="http://www.vslive.com">VSLive</a> Dallas along with some great other speakers. I attached the latest session code samples to this blog post since some of the code was written on the fly. It was a cold couple of days in Dallas, a brisk change from southwest Florida! But it really was a blast. We had a great group of speakers and attendees in a smaller atmosphere than some in the past. The result was even more discussions, great conversations and camaraderie. Some of the best discussions came from the <a href="http://www.vslive.com">VSLive</a> speaker panel event where several speakers including Richard, Rocky, Josh, <a href="http://silverlight.net/blogs/jesseliberty/">Jesse</a>, Rich and I all had to answer some interesting and some tough questions about .NET state today and its future. It was all great stuff and I look forward to the next one.</p>

    <p>Now that my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596523092/johnpanet-20">Silverlight 2 book</a> is going to be in stores very soon I’ve taken a look back at some of the books I wrote through the years. Here is a cover shot from an ADO book I coauthored eons ago. And no, the new book has a very normal cover … no more pyramids!</p>
<p>A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away … I wrote a book with 4 of my friends. The book may not be remembered, but the cover certainly has been. 10 years later I still have people come up to me and say “hey, that was you on that crazy cover!”. Ah, geeky humor :)</p>

    <p>My book went to print today, so it will be available for purchase as soon as they finish waxing and polishing it. I plan on having materials to supplement the book including all code samples in C# and VB, a forum for questions and discussions, as well as additional material on <a href="http://www.silverlight-data.com">www.silverlight-data.com</a> . These will be made available over the next few weeks as we get closer to the book being available at stores. The first of these are the forums, which was launched tonight. You can <a href="http://forums.oreilly.com/category/41/Data-Driven-Services-with-Silverlight-2/">check out the forums</a> and post any questions or general discussion right now over at the O’Reilly site. </p>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Earlier today I had the opportunity to present a session at <a href="http://www.tampacodecamp.com/">Tampa Code Camp</a> 2008 on ADO.NET Data Services and Silverlight 2. Oh, and the code camps was a nice place to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596523092/johnpanet-20">promote my new book too</a> :-). The session went well, we had lots of great questions, some good after the session chats, and none of my demos broke :-) … which is always good.&#160; As promised, <a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/downloads/TampaCodeCamp2008-AstoriaAndSilveright.pdf">here are the slides from my presentation.</a></p>

<p>The best part of code camps is the chance to meet up with people you don’t see face to face in the community on a regular basis. I really enjoy talking to everyone .. we have a fantastic .NET community here in Florida! People came from Naples, Jacksonville, Lakeland, Orlando, Tampa, Sarasota, Dunedin, Gainesville, and various other parts of Florida. I believe at one point <a href="http://www.devfish.com">Joe Healy</a> counted 250 attendees showed up (I may be wrong). Joe usually puts photos up for the vents, too, so keep an eye out for them. Overall, I had a great time even though I had about 4 hours of sleep between my company Christmas party (in Orlando) the night before and speaking at Tampa Code Camp the morning. I hope nobody noticed how tired I was :) The whole crew that put this together should feel proud. There were lots of them, so I won;t name them all for fear of missing someone … but it went off quite well.</p>
<p>Oh! I almost forgot …. I am honored to have <a href="http://www.timheuer.com">Tim Heuer</a> write the foreward for my book. We just sent the cover to the printer and the book will go to the printer this coming week. Tim was very kind to write the foreward for it and I am thrilled to have him included! </p>

    <p>This Saturday is the Tampa Code Camp 2008. The session lineup looks great so far, so be sure to stop by and spend some time learning, networking and just hanging out with a great group of people. </p>

<p>I will be presenting a session on Astoria and Silverlight in the morning at 9:40am. It should be a lot of fun, so please stop by and check it out. This is the last time I will be presenting this topic before the release of my book (its getting close!!!)</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<blockquote>   <h4><strong>Practical ADO.NET Data Services with Silverlight </strong></h4> ADO.NET Data Services (codenamed Astoria) exposes entity models through RESTful services. It can dramatically simplify the code required to expose business objects through web services and reduce a tremendous amount of code. This session will show how to expose entity models using ADO.NET Data Services, how to consume and save data, and how to debug the communications using tools such as Fiddler. When the technology does not quite do what you need out of the box, it also allows for customizations to create custom service operations, intercept queries, and enforce permissions. Attendees will walk away with an understanding of the capabilities of ADO.NET Data Services, how to use them with Silverlight, and when and where it is ideal to use in an application architecture.</blockquote>
