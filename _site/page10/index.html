    <p>Recently I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to be a guest on the Herding Code podcast and the Channel 9 Web Camps TV video series to discuss SPA.</p>

<h3>Herding Code Podcast</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mic-150x150.png" alt="mic" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-16591" />
The episode of the Herding Code podcast was hosted by <a href="http://twitter.com/jongalloway" target="_blank">Jon Galloway</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/odetocode" target="_blank">K Scott Allen</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/lazycoder" target="_blank">Scott Koon</a>. We sat down together, along with my friend <a href="http://twitter.com/wardbell" target="_blank">Ward Bell</a>, and we discussed the state of SPA today and the new Visual Studio templates. It was a very casual conversation between the 5 of us discussing a SPA from many angles. It’s a good listen for anyone who may share some of the same questions we posed and tried to answer in the podcast. You can <a href="http://herdingcode.com/wp-content/uploads/HerdingCode-0161-Single-Page-Applications.mp3" target="_blank">download the podcast directly</a> or  <a href="http://herdingcode.com/?p=523" target="_blank">listen to the podcast here or read the show’s notes</a> (which are very detailed).</p>

<h3>Web Camps TV</h3>

While at the MVP Summit in February, I was invited to my old stomping grounds in B20 to film an episode of Web Camps TV with <a href="https://www.twitter.com/bradygaster" target="_blank">Brady Gaster</a> and <a href="http://blog.syntaxc4.net/" target="_blank">Cory Fowler</a> on <a href="https://twitter.com/ch9" target="_blank">Channel 9</a>. We discussed Single Page Applications and showed a short demo of the new <a href="http://johnpapa.net/hottowel" target="_blank">Visual Studio template named “Hot Towel”</a> as well as the ASP.NET only NuGet package named <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/hottowelette" target="_blank">Hot Towelette</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://jpapa.me/spaps" target="_blank">intermediate SPA course</a> covers more topics, how to build more of the components manually, discusses many of the choices you can make, and covers some scenarios in more depth such as HTML5 Boilerplate, Web Optimization, Web API design, building rich data capabilities manually, and Responsive Web Design (and more).</p>

<p>To summarize:
SPA JumpStart for beginners –&gt; Teach me the core and “how”
SPA Intermediate –&gt; Teach me more depth, more topics, and more “why”</p>

<h3>Course Description</h3>
<p>Build a Single Page Application (SPA), in JavaScript and HTML, with a rich user experience and runs on almost any device! Start from File | New project and build a fully functional SPA with multiple pages, insert, update, delete, validation, and more. We’ll explore and build with the ASP.NET Hot Towel SPA template as well as powerful JavaScript libraries such as Durandal, Breeze, Knockout, toastr, Twitter Bootstrap, and jQuery.</p>

<h3>Live Demo</h3>
<p>I published a <a href="http://jpapa.me/ccjsdemo">live demo of the Code Camper Jump-Start SPA online</a>, hosted on Windows Azure. Please check it out give it a whirl.</p>

<h3>Source Code</h3>
<p>The course is designed so that you can follow along. However, if you want the source code it is included with the Pluralsight Plus subscription. In fact, each module builds off each other and I provided a before and after solution for every module. The final code base is in the “after” solution of module 10.</p>

<h3>Topics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Introduction to SPA</li>
<li>SPA Templates</li>
<li>SPA from Scratch</li>
<li>Foundations and Adding a View</li>
<li>Navigation with Durandal</li>
<li>Data Management with Breeze</li>
<li>Getting Data Efficiently</li>
<li>Saving and Checking for Changes</li>
<li>Adding and Deleting Data</li>
<li>Validating Data</li>
</ul>

<h3>What's Next?</h3>
<p>I have a bunch of courses in mind including expanding on Durandal, Breeze, Knockout, and JavaScript in general. I also have a ton of SPA tips that I have gathered and will produce a tips course. I expect to get moving on one of those soon or some other ideas I have once I take a few days off from authoring and unwind :)</p>

<h3>Questions?</h3>
<p>I recently posted a list of SPA questions I often receive. Please check this out as it likely contains some of the questions you may formulate at some point. If not, please feel free to ping me either by:</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/hottowel/javascript/pluralsight/spa/uncategorized/2013/03/14/spajs02.html">SPA JumpStart – Architecture – Part 2</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Any day now my new beginner level SPA JumpStart course for Pluralsight will be published. In this course I guide you through building a SPA step by step. I start with the new ASP.NET templates and quickly zero in on <a href="http://johnpapa.net/hottowel" target="_blank">Hot Towel</a>, my custom SPA template that was built for this course. From there, I break down all the core pieces of a SPA on the client.</p>

<p>While there are many ways to build a SPA, this course focuses on a specific architecture. I could spend days boring you with all of the options and combinations that you can combine into a witches brew to make a SPA. And frankly, that would be a lot of fun, but I highly doubt it would be productive as we’d all be left with no clear idea of where to start or how to proceed. Instead, I decided to pick a solid architecture that works well, has a gentle on ramp, and can be expanded on beyond the basics.</p>

<h3>The Client Players</h3>
<p>Here is a high level view of the players in the SPA on the client. (Follow the links to each of their NuGet packages)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://nuget.org/packages/Breeze.WebApi/" target="_blank">Breeze</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nuget.org/packages/Q/" target="_blank">Q</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nuget.org/packages/Durandal/" target="_blank">Durandal</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nuget.org/packages/Sammy.js/" target="_blank">Sammy.js</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nuget.org/packages/jQuery/" target="_blank">jQuery</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nuget.org/packages/knockoutjs/" target="_blank">Knockout.js</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nuget.org/packages/Moment.js/" target="_blank">Moment.js</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nuget.org/packages/RequireJS/" target="_blank">require.js</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nuget.org/packages/toastr/" target="_blank">toastr</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nuget.org/packages/Twitter.Bootstrap/" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nuget.org/packages/FontAwesome" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a></li>
</ul>

<p>All of these, except Font Awesome, are part of Hot Towel. They all play an important role in a SPA and many depend on each other.</p>

<h3>View Composition and App Life Cycle</h3>
<p>It’s a lot easier to build an app when you have a tool that helps you  do the simple, yet critical things. In a SPA it’s pretty darn important to be able to show a View, pair it with a ViewModel, and be able to hook into events in the app’s life-cycle. Durandal makes this super simple. You may not have heard of Durandal before as it is a newer player in this field, but it is built by the makers of Caliburn Micro, a very popular MVVM framework for .NET and XAML. It follows convention over configuration, which simply means if you name things certain ways, they just work. Kind of cool :) Of course you can override those conventions yourself too.</p>

<p>Durandal does much more too like helping with modal dialogs, event messaging, and creating custom widgets. But the biggest wins come with helping hook into the app life-cycle and composing your views. It makes very simple work out of these and allows you to focus on your app, not the plumbing. In fact, I rewrote my entire demo app in just a few days using Durandal and was able to reduce the code base considerably, and end up with a more fully featured app. The end result was well worth it and you will see Durandal through my course and as a featured player in Hot Towel.</p>

<p><img src="http://johnpapa.net/wp-content/images/HotTowelPreview.png" width="796" height="387" class="aligncenter" /></p>

<h3>Data Binding</h3>
<p>Data binding makes it easy for your data to flow between your source (ViewModel) and target (HTML Views) on the client. Knockout makes data binding easy. For example, Knockout removes the need for you to write a line of code to read data from your viewmodel and then stuffing it into HTML, and then another line of code to pull it back out of HTML and into your viewmodel when you want to save it. If your View has dozens of data points, you can easily see how valuable Knockout can be to reducing your code base. This binding helps with single data points, arrays, and calculated properties.</p>

<p>&lt;pre class=”prettyprint&gt;
// Assume firstName is a member of the viewmodel speakerVM
var firstName = ko.observableArray();
&lt;/pre&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;pre class=”prettyprint&gt;

<h3>Routing</h3>
<p>Your app is likely to have more than 1 View so it makes sense that you may want to handle paging between those different Views. One of the huge benefits of a SPA is that you keep the app running on the client in the browser, without making a roundtrip for every View change. This makes a solid routing library essential for a SPA. Sammy fits this bill quite nicely, and the good news is that Durandal wraps up Sammy to hide a lot of Sammy’s complexity. I worked hard on putting Durandal through the ringer and provided a lot of feedback on the router because I felt it was a critical piece of a SPA. I am very happy with how easy Durandal has made routing, which follows the same type of code that I built from scratch for my custom router in my intermediate SPA course.</p>

<p>You can set up Views and their routes in a variety of ways. One of the simpler ways is to assume the views and viewmodels are named to match each other (ex: speakers.js and speakers.html) and then add a route like this with <code>router.mapNav</code>:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
function boot() {
    router.mapNav('home');
    router.mapNav('details');
    return router.activate('home');
}
</pre>

<h3>Require.js</h3>
<p>Organizing your code, separating your JavaScript logic into units of similar roles and responsibilities, managing dependencies, and loading JavaScript files on demand. These are all key features to making your JavaScript app maintainable. How do we do this? I recommend using the Module Pattern (described in my course) and using the Require.js library, which follows the AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) pattern. Sounds like a mouthful, but really all you need to do is change your code from this</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
var speakersViewModel = (function (datacontext) {
    var speakers = ko.observableArray();

    var activate = function () {
        return datacontext.getSpeakerPartials(speakers);
    };
    var refresh = function () {
        return datacontext.getSpeakerPartials(speakers, true);
    };

    var vm = {
        activate: activate,
        speakers: speakers,
        title: 'Speakers',
        refresh: refresh
    };
    
    return vm;
})();
</pre>

<p>to this</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
define(['services/datacontext'], function (datacontext) {
    var speakers = ko.observableArray();

    var activate = function () {
        return datacontext.getSpeakerPartials(speakers);
    };
    var refresh = function () {
        return datacontext.getSpeakerPartials(speakers, true);
    };

    var vm = {
        activate: activate,
        speakers: speakers,
        title: 'Speakers',
        refresh: refresh
    };
    
    return vm;
});
</pre>

<p>Notice we just wrapped the module with a define statement. You’ll learn more about this in my course (its introduced in my beginner course and then I add more detail in my intermediate course).</p>

<h3>Rich Data</h3>
<p>This is a topic that you may not think you need until you try to build a SPA without it. If you don’t believe me, go build a SPA and try to share data across multiple view models and handle object graphs. Try to write code that queries locally first then remotely. Yeah, you can do it. I have. But when I switched to Breeze I removed a massive amount of code.</p>

<p>This topic is pretty huge and I cover quite a bit of Breeze in the course. But here is a glimpse are what you can do with Breeze:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
/* Query like LINQ */
// Define query for customers 
// starting with 'A', sorted by name,
var query = breeze.EntityQuery
           .from("Customers")
           .where("CompanyName", "startsWith", "A")
           .orderBy("CompanyName");
manager.executeQuery(query);
</pre>

<h3>Promises with Q</h3>
<p>Breeze relies on Q, which is a small and simple library that implements promises. Promises are important so we can handle asynchronous programming that is pervasive in disconnected client apps like SPA’s. With Q we can write things like the code below, which executes a query against a remote server. When it is done executing successfully, the then condition executes. However, if the query failed the fail condition executes. You could go “Old School” too, and use callbacks, but promises just make it all much easier.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
// Returns a promise
return manager.executeQuery(query)
    .then(querySucceeded)
    .fail(queryFailed);
</pre>

<h3>Alerts / Messages</h3>
<p>Most apps needs a way to tell the user when something happens. We have a few styles of doing this: modal windows, non modal windows, and transient windows. Toastr (A library I wrote) helps handle the transient windows. It is ideal for telling the user when something happened and then it fades away into the night. It’s easy to use and very adaptable too.
<a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/spajs02/3-13-2013-11-04-13-pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-16021"><img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/3-13-2013-11-04-13-PM.png" alt="3-13-2013 11-04-13 PM" width="371" height="77" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16021" /></a></p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
toastr.info('Data saved successfully');
</pre>

<p>I also use toastr as a logging mechanism while debugging (see Hot Towel for an example implementation).</p>

<h3>Dates</h3>
<p>Dates can really suck. Moment.js makes dates suck less. If you get data that contains a date, but that date is in some oddball format, Moment can help convert it to whatever format you want. It’s easy to use and handles manipulation of the dates too. Add days, minutes, years, calculate the difference in dates, convert date formats, format dates to strings: Yep, it’s in there.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
// Convert the start variable to a UTC date
// Then format it
var x = moment.utc(start).format('ddd hh:mm a');
</pre>

<p>It’s a small library with a singular focus. But that’s a good thing, as it does this one thing very well. I am hard-pressed to think of an app I have been involved with that did not have dates in it. I’ll gladly use moment in all future apps.</p>

<h3>Styling</h3>
<p>I’m no designer, so I will take all the help I can get with any design, including icons. Font Awesome helps add some simple icons that you can add easily to your app via CSS. For example, the following HTML adds a spinner icon.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
<i class="icon-spinner icon-spin icon-2x pull-left"></i>
</pre>
<p>Simply put, Font Awesome makes it simple to add icons for anywhere you need them, including buttons or spinners.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/spajs02/3-13-2013-10-52-17-pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-16011"><img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/3-13-2013-10-52-17-PM.png" alt="3-13-2013 10-52-17 PM" width="399" height="91" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16011" /></a></p>

<p>What about styles themselves? You may be used to jQuery UI or some other widget library, but for simple styles, layout, and responsive design I prefer Twitter Bootstrap. It uses CSS to style most elements, is easily configurable, and has some more complex components that are JavaScript based. Basically, Bootstrap allowed me to focus on writing the code for my app, and not worry so much about the design elements. I still customized some of the styles, but its ideal for getting off the ground quickly.</p>

<h3>The Server  Players</h3>
<p>to round things out, here are the key players on the server. I won;t go into each of these deeply as the focus of this course is on the client. The key takeaway here is that you can build our back-end however you like as long as you expose the HTTP services (ideally serving JSON).</p>

<li>Breeze Web API components</li>
<li>Entity Framework</li>
<li>ASP.NET Web API</li>

  <h2>
    <a href="/pluralsight/uncategorized/2013/03/11/modern-learning-mediums.html">Modern Learning Mediums</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I love music but its a rare album where I enjoy every song in the album. I’ve had the same experience with computer books. Often they contain a lot of great information, but only a percentage of the content is something I either want or need to know. 20 years ago, when I started down the path of getting into code, the primary medium for learning was easily text books. In fact, most books I purchased and read were easily in the 600 to 700 page range. They were difficult for me to get through and often covered many more topics that I cared to learn. I wish I had better options.</p>

<p>This post explores some of the learning mediums we have today and my experiences with them.</p>

<h3>The Learner</h3>
<p>I’m a very visual learner. I enjoy listening and watching. I enjoy the tone inflection of the presenter. I feed off of the instructor’s excitement. My attention span is easily diverted. Put this all together and you get the ideal audience for visual learning mediums. For me, that’s easily video courses. (Though there are many styles to video learning too.)  When learning brand new material, my preference is to watch videos. I like to be able to watch and listen first, then back up and follow along (with pauses). This gives me time to digest the information, then try it, and repeat if I don’t quite get it right away. The better the presenter, the faster I “get it” and have “aha” moments, too.</p>

<p>There are many learning mediums these days, and within each of those, many flavors. We have books, articles, blog posts, videos, in person training, conferences, mentoring, hands on labs, and pair programming! You can even combine many of these. Depending on the type of person you are, your experience with the topic, and how you prefer to absorb the information, you may prefer some of these mediums over others.</p>

<p>Also, some mediums are much less costly (or free) than others. An instructor led class may cost you $2000 for a week plus travel expenses and time off from work, while a blog post is usually free. Of course, what you get out of each of these mediums is entirely different, so you have to balance what you need to learn, your time, and your budget. I won’t try to tell you which way is best for you, only you can decide that. And in many cases, that may differ depending on what you need to learn and how fast, too. My recommendation is to spend time to figure out what you preferred learning style is. Try them all and and reflect on them to see which was most beneficial for you.</p>

<h3>The Author</h3>
<p>What may be easier for the author to create and communicate, may not be the best way for the learner to receive the information. For example, while I may prefer creating videos, perhaps you learn better by reading material. it is critical that an author determine what their best medium for communication is, too. I use a lot of body movement, tone inflection and visual aids to present material. This makes me more naturally suited for in person presentations, which makes sense since I love presenting at conferences and in person training. These are not practical for making a living for me, though, since they both require a lot of travel.</p>

<p>This is why I also lean on writing skills with books and articles, as well as video presentations through mediums like <a href="http://www.plrualsight.com" target="_blank">Pluralsight</a>. ALl of which allow me to spend more time wiht family and still express my inner “author”.</p>

<h3>Writing</h3>
<p>If you have not written much before, Twitter is an ideal ground zero. Yes, I said Twitter. The biggest block people get when writing is the pressure of being perfect, correct, and embarrassing themselves. On Twitter that pressure is alleviated to 140 characters. In other words, you have a greater chance of success in getting out a quick nugget of communication in 140 characters than you do in a 3500 word blog post or article. I highly recommend starting out here and engaging with people on technology topics. Use Twitter to sharpen your writing skills, and then move forward when you have more material and comfort.</p>

<p>Blog posts can be the natural next step for a writer. Like Twitter, you can be very casual an focus on just the topics you are really comfortable with. Got something to share that you are passionate about?  Blog it! Then share it on social media and get the word out. Reply to comments and again, engage in a conversation.</p>

<p>Articles are a great way to progress to the next level, and the feedback you got from your blogs and tweets will prepare you for the sometimes harsh realities of the comments you get from your articles’ technical and grammatical reviewers.</p>

<h3>Articles</h3>
<p>I often get asked if its worth it to write an article or book. The answer is always “it depends”. If you want the experience and have the passion to drive it through, then of course it is worth it. If you are just looking for money, then it is likely not worth it. Articles are easier to get out, but the pay is often very slight, and the time to market is usually a few months. So if you write it in January and submit at the end of the month, it might be published April 1st for print editions. For online, a little sooner. I prefer print magazines because they often extend the reach beyond pure online only. Also, many paid online magazine sites are ad heavy or very unfriendly to read from (there are exceptions of course).</p>

<p>The good side is that the time to market is not terrible for print magazines, which makes the information much more timely. If the content is new tech, 3 months may be too long, though. we live in a fast world. The reach is good as you likely will get many thousands of readers. You likely won’t get much in pay, but magazine writing is a great way to make a splash into a wider audience.</p>

<h3>Books</h3>
<p>This is bay far the biggest question I get on this topic: “Is it worth it to write a book?”. Again, the answer is “it depends”. If you want money, unless you self publish you likely won;t get much out of a book. So I do not recommend getting into book writing for the money. A better reason to do it is the resume building and experience of writing a book. The upside is that people tend to look at an author and think “wow, s/he wrote a book!”. This tends to leave a good impression in the minds of fellow developers and prospective employers. This really can’t be discounted as it has most certainly been the case that I have noticed both first hand and in other authors’ interactions.</p>

<p>Writing 10 or 20 books can also be impressive, but honestly, my gut says that after 1 or 2 the incremental gain is inconsequential and not worth the additional return.</p>

<p>The downside of books (besides pay) is that they often take a huge toll on the writer. My books often took me 6 months or more to write. They dont pay enough to do it full time, so I had to do this at night, which is very common for technical book authors. Once you submit the draft, there are rounds of edits for formatting, grammar and tech review. These can take a month or more. Then you have the time to press. Most of my books were 9 months from the time I wrote chapter 1 til the time anyone got to buy and receive a copy. To put that in context in an extreme example, I wrote Silverlight 2 Data Services when Silverlight 2 came out. But it was released as Silverlight 3 was released, and Silverlight 4 was beginning. This was about 10 months in total.</p>

<p>The time to write and the time to market are the top 2 reasons I don’t write books anymore. i like to get content out quickly while its hot on my mind. Also, i can move faster through videos, talking, and demos. So books don;t lend themselves to the speed at which I want to get the content authored.</p>

<p>Notice I avoided talking too much about pay for books. That’s because there isn’t a whole lot to talk about here. If you want pay for books, either become famous and publish a really wide reaching topic or self publish. The best bet is to publish what you are passionate about. Writing a book is an experience you should try, but not “quit my job and go for it” move. I don’t recommend that unless you are independently wealthy.</p>

<h3>Videos</h3>
<p>if you stuck with me this far, you probably know I am currently engrossed in creating video training for Pluralsight. I find the video medium a great fit for me as I enjoy the tone inflection, visual demonstrations, and quicker time to market. Generally, when I am done with a course it is published within a week. For me, that quick turnaround is very gratifying.</p>

<p>So what is the downside? The only thing I don’t get from Pluralsight videos that I personally thrive on is the face to face interaction. But unless we can zap me into people’s devices, I don’t think there is much anyone can do about that. And frankly, that would be creepy to have me just show up at your place :)</p>

<p>The pay? It has only been about a year, but the pay for videos has been on par and better than books I have written.</p>

<p>For topics courses like TypeScript or Knockout, where I focus on 1 topic and cover it widely, it takes me about 24 hours per module to write demos, slides, record and edit. For end to end courses, that average goes up to about 40 hours per module. For recording and editing, it takes me about 1 hour to produce 5 (to 10) minutes of video. it’s slow, but still more fun than writing.

  <h2>
    <a href="/faq/spa/uncategorized/2013/03/07/spa-questions.html">SPA Questions</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I’m taking my own advice here and responding to some frequently asked questions I receive on SPA on my blog. I get some of these a lot and it just makes sense that I aggregate them and share for discussion. The questions are all good and they cover a variety of experiences. Hopefully by sharing them, they will be of benefit to others.</p>

<p>I encourage you to also chime in with your comments if you have more to add or have other questions.</p>

<h3>Q1: Is SPA the future web trend?</h3>
<p>SPA has been around for years, but recently it has gained a lot of momentum. It is an emerging area, for sure. However, the reasons businesses are attracted to it usually come down to its 3 core aspects:</p>
<ul><li>Reach</li>
<li>Reduced Round Tripping</li>
<li>Rich User Experience</li>
</ul>

<p>I think the web trend is more accurately depicted by achieving these 3 R’s.</p>

<h3>Q2: How do you secure a Web APIs for a SPA?</h3>
<p>Web API can certainly be secured and the good news is that some of the ASP.NET MVC / SPA templates demonstrate this. Specifically, check out the SPA template that comes with <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/asp-net-spa-templates/" target="_blank">VS 2012.2 Update mentioned here</a>. There are a variety of ways to implement security, this is one. You can also implement security at the method level.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
    [Authorize]
    [ValidateHttpAntiForgeryToken]
    public class TodoController : ApiController
    {
        // Controller methods go here
    }
</pre>

<p>The anti forgery attributes are also worth considering, if that suits you. Check out the SPA template and the <a href="http://www.asp.net/single-page-application/overview/templates/breezeknockout-template" target="_blank">Breeze SPA template</a> for more concrete details.</p>

<h3>Q3: Can anyone query for any server-side data?</h3>
<p>Only if you allow them to. If you have data that should not be queryable, don’t make it queryable. Lock down sensitive data like you would in any app. Most samples and demos will show what you can do but making Web API methods IQueryable. There are huge benefits to making the data flexible like this, but when specific data should be locked down, absolutely do that. One way to limit data is to remove IQueryable and construct the exact query on the server. You can also use a specific RPC like action in your Web API.  Yet another way is to use IQueryable on a method, but have it return a projection of the data (return all fields and rows except the sensitive ones). The bottom line is that security is still important and is still placed on the developer’s shoulders to follow the requirements.</p>

<h3>Q4: Does SPA work only with a .NET back-end?</h3>
<p>SPA works on the client, so it works with any web server technology. It works great with a .NET back end, and my preference is an ASP.NET back end. However you can absolutely use PHP, Java, Azure cloud service, or a node.js server (just a few examples). The key concept here is reach: SPA allows for a multitude of devices and client browsers regardless of the back end. You can hook to any of them and call web services through AJAX.</p>

<h3>Q5: Which core libraries should I choose for SPA?</h3>
<p><a href="http://durandaljs.com" target="_blank">Durandal</a> with <a href="http://knockoutjs.com" target="_blank">Knockout</a>, <a href="http://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">Angular</a>, <a href="http://emberjs.com/" target="_blank">Ember</a>, and <a href="http://backbonejs.org/" target="_blank">Backbone</a> are just a few solid choices.The key is in picking one that suits you. I prefer Durandal with Knockout because I believe it is easy to follow, scales well, is easy to build on, doesn’t try to do too much, and has a great data binding core (which I prefer). Angular is another library I like as it has similar qualities. If you have time, it is certainly worth looking into these and choosing your favorite. They all have pros and cons and very different styles. There are other choices too, like Batman or CanJS.</p>

<p>The key is not to get hampered by choosing, but to choose one that fits for you, your project, your team, and allows you to build on it. You can always choose another one later for your next project :)</p>

<h3>Q6: Which core libraries do you recommend?</h3>
<p>I prefer the combination of Durandal and Knockout along with some others like Breeze and toastr. If you install <a href="http://johnpapa.net/hottowel" target="_blank">HotTowel</a> you will get my core list of preferences.</p>

<h3>Q7: Does Hot Towel work with ASP.NET (no MVC) ?</h3>
<p>Yes, but you will want the NuGet package named HotTowelette. <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/hottowel" target="_blank">Hot Towel</a> is designed for ASP.NET MVC while <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/hottowelette" target="_blank">Hot Towelette</a> is designed for ASP.NET without MVC. The libraries and App JavaScript are the same in both. The only differences are in using MVC routing vs a startup HTML page. In fact, both use ASP.NET razor, web optimization, and Web API too.</p>

<h3>Q8: How much data should be pushed to the client in a SPA?</h3>
<p>These are the determining factors in how much data to send to the client in an initial page:</p>
<ul><li>Data that will be displayed for that first page</li>
<li>Lookup list data for any drop downs on that page</li>
<li>Data that is required for and presentation rules</li>
</ul>
<p>On a view that would show a list of recipes, I would get the recipes and some key factors to display (like recipe name, the dish, and other key info) that can be displayed in a list. Enough for the user to make a determination on what to pick. Then when the user dives into a recipe, then go get that 1 recipe’s details.</p>

<p>The general rule is get what you user will almost certainly need up front. Then get other data as they request it.</p>

<h3>Q9: Why doesn't Hot Towel include more examples?</h3>
<p>It’s the difference in my mind of a template and a sample. Hot Towel is a template to build on. A sample would include more example code (that would be ripped out later by you).</p>

<p>When I built the Hot Towel template I had a focus on providing enough to get folks going with the right tools, and just enough starter code to guide the way. I did not want anyone ripping out code. I’m not a fan of templates that start you down a path and make you remove tons of files and code and change direction. Those are samples.</p>

<p>Samples are good. In fact, samples can be excellent (like the other templates, which I feel are more like samples). Those serve another purpose: to show how you can do things.</p>

<p>Back to the Hot Towel template …if I include code that uses Breeze, I would be tempted to add a datacontext.js and a model.js on the client. They would contain data access code and code to extend the models on the client. Then I would be tempted to add a controller, some server-side models, an ORM and a database. Once there, I’d want to use the data in multiple screens, which leads me to more Knockout and caching with Breeze. Then I might be tempted to add editing, which would lead to change tracking. Soon I have a full-blown app. Or more conservatively, I have a sample again. While these approaches would provide more guidance on how to put these together, they would not help you “get started” with a template where you can just start building and adding your own code. If I stop short of some of these features, it’s still walking down a road that requires you to change how I did it.</p>

<p>As it stands today, Hot Towel is pretty darn close to a template in the truest sense. You create a new project and you are off and adding your own code.</p>

<p>You could argue (and you may be) that Breeze shouldn’t be in there since I don’t use it in the template. Nor do I use moment.js, BTW. However, I argue that they are both excellent libraries that I would not want to build a CRUD based SPA without them.</p>

<h3>Approach to My Existing Intermediate Level SPA Course</h3>
<p>And now for some background context …</p>

<p>When I set out to record <a href="http://jpapa.me/spaps" target="_blank">my intermediate level SPA course</a>, I purposefully demonstrated how to create all of the code, why I went town those paths, and hand crafted much of the code. The code was involved in some cases (think the data service module and its related modules) but it got across the point: <strong>you can build a robust app as a SPA</strong> without any magic. At the time, and to an extent still today, SPA was widely a misunderstood or unknown. Thus, the approach I took was purposefully targeting a wide spectrum of possibilities that you can explore with a SPA. I also avoided magical frameworks that “do it all” for you, because the journey (in this case) is more important than the end result. Otherwise, I could just show a wizard :)</p>

<p>This approach was arguably successful, and somewhat unconventional. The problem is that I started the story in the middle of the book, which caused some to wonder how to start. I totally get that and that’s a problem I can deal with and have addressed with my new course SPA JumpStart.</p>

<h3>Approach to My New SPA JumpStart SPA Course</h3>
<p>I cover tools in my new SPA JumpStart course that handle most of my data management and view and viewmodel composition. These tools are fantastic and hide a lot of the complexity that I hand rolled into the intermediate course. I also demonstrate some NuGet packages and Visual Studio 2012 Templates that I think you will really like, as I created these specifically for this course. I’ll explore these and many other areas through the course and this blog post series.</p>

<h3>Tell Me Again?</h3>
<p>To sum up the differences, this course provides a beginner’s jump-start to getting running with a SPA quickly. You’ll have all the fundamentals in place and get to join me in walking through building all of the code with me. The intermediate course covers more topics, how to build more of the components manually, discusses many of the choices you can make, and covers some scenarios in more depth such as HTML5 Boilerplate, Web Optimization, Web API design, building rich data capabilities manually, and Responsive Web Design (and more).</p>

<p>Or for a really short summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>SPA JumpStart --&gt; Teach me the core and "how"</li>
<li><a href="http://jpapa.me/spaps" target="_blank">SPA Intermediate</a> --&gt; Teach me more depth, more topics, and more "why"</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Hot Towel: Because you don't want to go to the SPA without one!</blockquote>

<p><img alt="" src="http://johnpapa.net/wp-content/images/HotTowelPreview.png" /></p>

<p>Hot Towel creates a great starting point for building a <a href="http://johnpapa.net/spa" target="_blank">Single Page Application (SPA)</a> with ASP.NET. Out of the box you it provides a modular structure for your code, view navigation, data binding, rich data management and simple but elegant styling. It provides everything you need to build a SPA, so you can focus on your app, not the plumbing.</p>
<blockquote>Learn more about building a SPA from <a href="http://johnpapa.net/spa?vsix">my videos, tutorials and Pluralsight courses</a>.</blockquote>

<h2>Create a New SPA Template Project with Hot Towel</h2>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<ul><li>Visual Studio 2012 or Visual Studio Express 2012 for Web</li>
<li>ASP.NET Web Tools 2012.2 update. You can install the update here.</li></ul>
<p>Start Visual Studio and select New Project from the Start page. Or, from the File menu, select New and then Project.</p>

<p>In the Templates pane, select Installed Templates and expand the Visual C# node. Under Visual C#, select Web. In the list of project templates, select ASP.NET MVC 4 Web Application. Name the project and click OK.

<p>In the New Project wizard, select Single Page Application.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/hottowel/2-18-2013-2-02-02-pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-15601"><img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2-18-2013-2-02-02-PM.png" alt="2-18-2013 2-02-02 PM" width="600" height="469" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15601" /></a></p>

<h2>Application Structure</h2>
<p>Hot Towel SPA provides an App folder which contains the JavaScript and HTML files that define your application.</p>

<p>Inside the App folder:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://johnpapa.net/wp-content/images/HotTowelAppFolder.png" /></p>

<p>The App folder contains a collection of modules. These modules encapsulate functionality and declare dependencies on other modules. The views folder contains the HTML for your application and the viewmodels folder contains the presentation logic for the views (a common MVVM pattern). The services folder is ideal for housing any common services that your application may need such as HTTP data retrieval or local storage interaction. It is common for multiple viewmodels to re-use code from the service modules.</p>
<h2>ASP.NET MVC Server Side Application Structure</h2>
<p>Hot Towel builds on the familiar and powerful ASP.NET MVC structure.</p>
<ul>
	<li>App_Start</li>
	<li>Content</li>
	<li>Controllers</li>
	<li>Models</li>
	<li>Scripts</li>
	<li>Views</li>
</ul>
<h2>Featured Libraries</h2>
<ul>
	<li>ASP.NET MVC</li>

<h2>Installing via the Visual Studio 2012 Hot Towel SPA Template</h2>
<p>Hot Towel can be installed as a Visual Studio 2012 template. Just click <code>File</code> | <code>New Project</code> and choose <code>ASP.NET MVC 4 Web Application</code>. Then select the <code>Hot Towel Single Page Application</code> template and run!</p>
<h2>Installing via the NuGet Package</h2>
<p><a href="http://nuget.org/packages/HotTowel/" target="_blank">Hot Towel is also a NuGet package</a> that augments an existing empty ASP.NET MVC project. Just install using Nuget and then run!
<a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/hottowel/hottowel-install-nuget/" rel="attachment wp-att-15011"><img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/hottowel-install-nuget.png" alt="hottowel install nuget" width="469" height="69" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15011" /></a></p>
<h2>How Do I Build On Hot Towel?</h2>
<p>Simply start adding code!</p>
<ol>
	<li>Add your own server-side code, preferably Entity Framework and WebAPI (which really shine with Breeze.js)</li>
	<li>Add views to the <code>App/views</code> folder</li>
	<li>Add viewmodels to the <code>App/viewmodels</code> folder</li>
	<li>Add HTML and Knockout data bindings to your new views</li>
	<li>Update the navigation routes in <code>shell.js</code></li>
</ol>
<h2>Walkthrough of the HTML/JavaScript</h2>
<h4>Views/HotTowel/index.cshtml</h4>
<p>index.cshtml is the starting route and view for the MVC application. It contains all the standard meta tags, css links, and JavaScript references you would expect. The body contains a single <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> which is where all of the content (your views) will be placed when they are requested. The <code>@Scripts.Render</code> uses Require.js to run the entrance point for the application’s code, which is contained in the <code>main.js</code> file. A splash screen is provided to demonstrate how to create a splash screen while your app loads.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
<body>
    <div id="applicationHost">
        @Html.Partial("_splash")
    </div>

    @Scripts.Render("~/scripts/vendor")
        &lt;script type="text/javascript" 
            src="~/App/durandal/amd/require.js" 
            data-main="@Url.Content("~/App/main")"&gt;
</body>
</pre>
<h4>App/main.js</h4>
<p>The <code>main.js</code> file contains the code that will run as soon as your app is loaded. This is where you want to define your navigation routes, set your start-up views, and perform any setup/bootstrapping such as priming your application’s data.</p>

<p>The <code>main.js</code> file defines several of durandal’s modules to help the application kick-start. The define statement helps resolve the modules dependencies so they are available for the function. First the debugging messages are enabled, which send messages about what events the application is performing to the console window. The app.start code tells the durandal framework to start the application. The conventions are set so that durandal knows all views and viewmodels are contained in the same named folders, respectively. Finally, the <code>app.setRoot</code> kicks loads the <code>shell</code> using a predefined <code>entrance</code> animation.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
define(['durandal/app', 
        'durandal/viewLocator', 
        'durandal/system', 
        'durandal/plugins/router'],
    function (app, viewLocator, system, router) {

    // Enable debug message to show in the console 
    system.debug(true);

    app.start().then(function () {
        router.useConvention();
        viewLocator.useConvention();
        //Show the app by setting the root view 
        // model for our application.
        app.setRoot('viewmodels/shell', 'entrance');
    });
});
</pre>
<h2>Views</h2>
<p>Views are found in the <code>App/views</code> folder.</p>
<h4>shell.html</h4>
<p>The <code>shell.html</code> contains the master layout for your HTML. All of your other views will be composed somewhere in side of your <code>shell</code> view. Hot Towel provides a <code>shell</code> with three such regions: a header, a content area, and a footer. Each of these regions is loaded with contents form other views when requested.</p>

<p>The <code>compose</code> bindings for the header and footer are hard-coded in Hot Towel to point to the <code>nav</code> and <code>footer</code> views, respectively. The compose binding for the section <code>#content</code> is bound to the <code>router</code> module’s active item. In other words, when you click a navigation link its corresponding view is loaded in this area.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><div>
    <header>
        <!--ko compose: {view: 'nav'} --><!--/ko-->
    </header>
     <section id="content" class="main container-fluid">
        <!--ko compose: {model: router.activeItem, 
            afterCompose: router.afterCompose, 
            transition: 'entrance'} -->
        <!--/ko-->
    </section>
    <footer>
        <!--ko compose: {view: 'footer'} --><!--/ko-->
    </footer>
</div>
</pre>
<h4>nav.html</h4>
<p>The <code>nav.html</code> contains the navigation links for the SPA. This is where the menu structure can be placed, for example. Often this is data bound (using Knockout) to the <code>router</code> module to display the navigation you defined in the <code>shell.js</code>. Knockout looks for the data-bind attributes and binds those to the <code>shell</code> viewmodel to display the navigation routes and to show a progressbar (using Twitter Bootstrap) if the <code>router</code> module is in the middle of navigating from one view to another (see <code>router.isNavigating</code>).</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
<nav class="navbar navbar-fixed-top">
    <div class="navbar-inner">
        <a class="brand" href="/">
            <span class="title">Hot Towel SPA</span> 
        </a>
        <div class="btn-group" data-bind="foreach: router.visibleRoutes">
            <a data-bind="css: { active: isActive }, 
                attr: { href: hash }, 
                text: name" class="btn btn-info" href="#"></a>
        </div>
        <div class="loader pull-right" data-bind="css: { active: router.isNavigating }">
            <div class="progress progress-striped 
                        active page-progress-bar">
                <div class="bar" style="width: 100px;"></div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</nav>
</pre>
<h4>home.html and details.html</h4>
<p>These views contain HTML for custom views. When the <code>home</code> link in the <code>nav</code> view’s menu is clicked, the <code>home</code> view will be placed in the content area of the <code>shell</code> view. These views can be augmented or replaced with your own custom views.</p>
<h4>footer.html</h4>
<p>The <code>footer.html</code> contains HTML that appears in the footer, at the bottom of the <code>shell</code> view.</p>
<h2>ViewModels</h2>
<p>ViewModels are found in the <code>App/viewmodels</code> folder.</p>
<h4>shell.js</h4>
<p>The <code>shell</code> viewmodel contains properties and functions that are bound to the <code>shell</code> view. Often this is where the menu navigation bindings are found (see the <code>router.mapNav</code> logic).</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
define(['durandal/system', 
        'durandal/plugins/router', 
        'services/logger'],
    function (system, router, logger) {
        var shell = {
            activate: activate,
            router: router
        };

        return shell;

        function activate() {
            return boot();
        }

        function boot() {
            router.mapNav('home');
            router.mapNav('details');
            log('Hot Towel SPA Loaded!', null, true);
            return router.activate('home');
        }

        function log(msg, data, showToast) {
            logger.log(msg, 
                data, 
                system.getModuleId(shell), 
                showToast);
        }
    });
</pre>
<h4>home.js and details.js</h4>
<p>These viewmodels contain the properties and functions that are bound to the <code>home</code> view. it also contains the presentation logic for the view, and is the glue between the data and the view.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
define(['services/logger'], 
function (logger) {
    var vm = {
        activate: activate,
        title: 'Home View'
    };

    return vm;

    function activate() {
        logger.log('Home View Activated', 
            null, 'home', true);
        return true;
    }
});
</pre>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Services are found in the App/services folder. Ideally your future services such as a dataservice module, that is responsible for getting and posting remote data, could be placed.</p>
<h4>logger.js</h4>
<p>Hot Towel provides a <code>logger</code> module in the services folder. The <code>logger</code> module is ideal for logging messages to the console and to the user in pop up toasts.</p>

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Today the ASP.NET team released the RTM version of the ASP.NET and Web Frameworks 2012.2. This includes updates for ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web API, ASP.NET Web Pages, Web Optimization, SignalR, and the ASP.NET SPA Template. The <a href="http://jpapa.me/scottguaspnetwt" target="_blank">official announcement is on Scott Guthrie’s blog</a>.</p>

<p>I’ll focus this post on the new SPA templates that accompany this release.</p>

<style>
tr {
    border-bottom: #e7e7e7 1px dotted;
}
thead {
    font-weight: bold;
}
table tr td:first-child {

<blockquote>I'll also be discussing the various templates in my upcoming (March 2013) <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com" target="_blank">Pluralsight </a>course titled "SPA Jump Start". This course is perfect for developers who want to know how to get started with SPA as I walk through creating a SPA from scratch to completion. This is a beginner level course that focuses on staying productive by leaning on some great libraries while my <a href="http://jpapa.me/spaps" target="_blank">intermediate level SPA course</a> shows how to create many of the features by hand. </blockquote>

<h2>ASP.NET SPA Template</h2>
<p>The intent of this template is to provide a starting place and sample for building a basic SPA with 1 view. If you want to move on from here to provide other features such as multiple views and sharing of data across those views, you can do that by pulling in other libraries like Sammy.js or Breeze.js (or choose your own favorites). Once you understand the SPA fundamentals, you can move on to build your own SPA using this as a starter model or see Hot Towel for a jump-start.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2-17-2013-11-49-15-PM.png" alt="2-17-2013 11-49-15 PM" width="500" height="347" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15311" /></p>

<p>I previously described the ASP.NET SPA template in my post <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/inside-the-asp-net-single-page-apps-template/" target="_blank">Inside the ASP.NET SPA Template</a> here. Only a few things have changed since then in this template since its RC in December 2012. They added camelCasing of the JavaScript variables, which are converted from PascalCase from the server. This is nice since that is a common convention.</p>

<p>You will also find one of the helpers for the new Knockout binding features in Visual Studio, too. Look in the <code>todo.viewmodel.js</code> and you will find a special comment (shown below) that helps when you are trying to get intellisense inside a <code>foreach</code> binding on the <code>todoLists</code> member.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
window.todoApp.todoListViewModel = (function (ko, datacontext) {
    /// <field name="todoLists" value="[new datacontext.todoList()]"></field>
    var todoLists = ko.observableArray(),

</pre>

<p>This provides intellisense when inside a foreach binding.</p>

<h2>Hot Towel SPA Template</h2>

<blockquote>Hot Towel: Because you don't want to go to the SPA without one!</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.asp.net/single-page-application/overview/templates/hottowel-template" target="_blank">Download the VSIX for the Hot Towel SPA template here</a></p>

<p>The Hot Towel SPA template is different from the other templates and makes use of a lot more JavaScript libraries, including Breeze, Durandal, Knockout, RequireJS and Twitter Bootstrap. It provides a more complete application from which you can build your own. There are more concepts to be aware of, but once you understand the nature of rich client and Single Page Applications, this template might just be what you are looking for. If you want to build a SPA but can’t decide where to start, use Hot Towel and in seconds you’ll have a SPA and all the tools you need to build on it! You can <a href=" http://www.johnpapa.net/hottowel" target="_blank">learn more about Hot Towel here</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://johnpapa.net/wp-content/images/HotTowelPreview.png" /></p>

<h2>BreezeJS SPA Template</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.breezejs.com/" target="_blank">Breeze </a>is an open source library for managing rich data in a JavaScript client. It handles querying, caching, change tracking, validation and more. The BreezeJS SPA template extends the ASP.NET SPA template with Breeze, showing how easily you can build a Single Page Application with BreezeJS for data and KnockoutJS for binding. Breeze is also featured in the Hot Towel SPA template.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.asp.net/single-page-application/overview/templates/breezeknockout-template" target="_blank">Download the VSIX for the Breeze SPA template here</a></p>

<h2>Durandal SPA Template</h2>
<p><a href="http://durandaljs.com/" target="_blank">Durandal </a>is a new open source JavaScript library for rich client application development. It focuses on providing an enjoyable and productive developer experience centered around simple conventions and standard patterns like MVC, MVP and MVVM. The Durandal template provides a bare-bones starting point for a typical navigation-style application architecture, ready for your own content and features. Durandal is also featured in the Hot Towel SPA template.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.asp.net/single-page-application/overview/templates/durandaljs-template" target="_blank">Download the VSIX for the Durandal SPA template here</a></p>

<h2>EmberJS SPA Template</h2>
<p>If you prefer using the <a href="http://emberjs.com/" target="_blank">Ember </a>JavaScript library, then try the new EmberJS SPA template. Ember is a powerful MVC JavaScript library that solves a wide array of challenges for building rich client applications. The Ember template is an implementation of the same Knockout SPA template shipped with ASP.NET and Web Tools 2012.2, but uses EmberJS and Handlebars templating.</p>
