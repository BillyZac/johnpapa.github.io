AngularJS 1.2 shifted to a more modular approach where the core AngularJS features are in angular.js while other functionality such as routing, animation, and resource are located in their own separate files. Each file hosts a module that you can optionally include in your project.</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/angular/javascript/uncategorized/2013/09/14/angular-growth-structure.html">Angular Structure&#58; Refactoring for Growth</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Your <a href="http://www.angularjs.org" target="_blank">Angular</a> app is growing and you want your structure to adapt with it. Let's explore one way you can approach this.</p>

<p>As your app grows it becomes even more important to structure it in a way that makes it easy to manage and maintain it. I <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/structuring-an-angular-project/" target="_blank">recently posted a common technique I use when I create a new app to help structure it</a>. A simple structure by type is easy out of the gate, as the app generally starts with a single set of features. This usually starts as the first module you write. Now fast forward and imagine you are working on an app that has a handful of modules, with dozens of views and controllers. How do you organize your code now?</p>

<h2>Options for Managing Growth</h2>

<p>I like the type organization (folders for controllers and views, for example), but as an app grows, instead of putting that at the root and putting all views and controllers in their own folders, sometimes it makes more sense to organize them 1 level deeper into feature areas. For a similar approach, see <a href="http://cliffmeyers.com/blog/2013/4/21/code-organization-angularjs-javascript" target="_blank">Cliff Meyer's great post</a>. We tend to look for the one right answer, but often there are many good options. You have to choose what feels right for you.</p>

<p>So how might this look? There are a lot of ways we could do this, but let's focus on two options side by side. <img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/NgStructureCompare.jpg" alt="NgStructureCompare" width="529" height="596" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21361" /></p>

<h2>Sort By Type</h2>

<p>On the left we have the app organized by type. Not too bad for smaller apps, but even here you can start to see it gets more difficult to find what you are looking for. When I want to find a specific view and its controller, they are in different folders. It can be good to start here if you are not sure how else to organize the code as it is quite easy to shift to the technique on the right: structure by feature.</p>

<h2>Sort By Feature</h2>

<p>On the left the project is organized by feature. All of the layout views and controllers go in the <code>layout</code> folder, the admin content goes in the <code>admin</code> folder, and the services that are used by all of the areas go in the <code>services</code> folder. The idea here is that when you are looking for the code that makes a feature work, it is located in one place. Services are a bit different as they "service" many features. I like this once my app starts to take shape as it becomes a lot easier to manage for me.</p>

<h2>Structuring for Modules</h2>

<p>This structure by feature can be extended fairly easily once you start to gather multiple modules. When i see common functionality that can be extracted and re-used, I like to break that out into its own module. In the structure by feature notice that I have a common folder. In there I have another module named <code>common</code> that contains logging, progress bars, and other common features. Sometimes I break this out such that the modules are the first folder under the <code>app</code> folder. But in this case I just had 2 modules: common and the main app.</p>

<p>As the app grows even further, you can have many modules. That's when I like to have the modules in their own folders under app. Specifically when the main app has very separate feature areas like <code>point of sale</code> and <code>inventory</code>, for example. Those could be their own modules. Then I'd also have some other common modules. See where this is heading? Separate silos of features that are easily separated (think Separation of Concerns).</p>

<h2>Your Choice</h2>

<p>Ultimately how you organize your code is entirely up to you and your team. Don't feel married to your choice, you can adapt when it makes sense. The key is in keeping good separation and making it easy to find your code.</p>

    <a href="/haswell/intel/review/uncategorized/2013/09/13/intel-haswell-battery-life.html">Intel Haswell Battery Life</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Intel sent me a prototype of a Haswell Developer Ultrabook to review in August. Last month I wrote a about my <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/intel-haswell-first-look/" target="_blank">first impressions of the Intel Haswell Ultrabook</a>, which were pretty good. Since then I have used this ultrabook extensively on a daily basis and brought it with me to present several sessions at several conferences.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/haswell-trim.jpg" alt="haswell trim" width="600" height="165" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20991" /></p>

<p>Before I give my impressions, <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/AMonthWithAnIntelHaswellPrototype.aspx" target="_blank">like Scott</a>, I had several issues with the pre-production hardware. It wasn’t unexpected as these are not-for-resale prototypes, which Intel made very clear to me. The idea is to review the Intel hardware such as the Haswell chip, so I’ll separate my experience with the Haswell chip from the pre-production prototype unit.</p>

<h2>In a Nutshell</h2>
<p>Haswell is awesome. Whether you want a Mac, Dell, Lenovo or whatever your favorite brand is, make sure it has the Haswell chip. You won’t regret it.</p>

<h2>Prototype Unit</h2>
<p>I’m on my 2nd unit, with a 3rd on its way. The first had major issues with the fan where it would constantly run for days. Oddly, this has now stopped after 5 weeks. I am not sure what is (or was) causing it but it was so loud I couldn’t hear folks around me. The machine was not hot and I’ve never had a laptop that ran the fan 100% of the time from boot to shut down. I also had some issues with drivers early on, but that’s the life of a pre-production unit. My second unit was quiet as can be, but 2 keys on the keyboard were broken. 1 fell off with broken plastic while the other (the space bar) only worked if you told it a bedtime story. Why explain this? Because despite my awesome experience with this laptop overall, the fan noise made it a huge detracting feature.</p>

<p>In this post I am reviewing the first unit, which I have had for 5+ weeks (loud fan and all).</p>

<h2>Haswell Chip</h2>
<p>I’ve used sub 3 pound laptops for 4 years now. I’ll never go back. Not just the laptops, but also their power bricks are lightweight. as much as I carry around my  laptop I don;t need to carry the additional weight. Now we can get great performance and great looks in a small sub 3 lb package. But what about battery life? That used to suffer big time. That’s where the Haswell steps in.</p>

<p>My standard day would be to open the Intel Haswell Ultrabook unit in the morning and use it for an hour before heading to work (unplugged). Then I go to work (without the power brick) toting along the Intel Haswell Ultrabook and use it for most of the work day (let’s say 4 hours of usage, because I have a desktop there too). When I get home I usually have about 40% battery remaining. That’s after 5 hours of usage! I then crank up the laptop at night and watch some TV with the family while I do some open source work or work on <a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/Authors/Details/john-papa" target="_blank">my Pluralsight courses</a>. I usually get another 2 hours in (7 total) before I feel the need to plug-in. I have not run it down to 0% battery, but I’ve never gotten less than 6 hours on the laptop unplugged and I have gotten as much as 8 hours.</p>

<p>I use Visual Studio and development tools extensively. I also play several games on Windows 8 on the machine for breaks. So it’s not like I am just surfing the web (which is less intensive on the battery). I keep the brightness level on the screen bright, which can drain battery (as much as an hour of a charge). ALl this said, I am pretty thrilled with the battery life of the Haswell. I’ve gotten half that (at best) from previous machines.</p>

<h2>Specs</h2>
<p>To review the specs on this unit, it is an i5 1.40Ghz processor, 4GB RAM, and a 180GB SSD drive. I was concerned about speed since I normally prefer 8gb RAM and an i7, but so far this Ultrabook has not disappointed me at all in my early tests. Of course it has all the standard ports and then some (USB 3, Bluetooth, WiFi, SD card slot, and more) and it has 3 dongles for other adapters as I previously mentioned. I’m not a fan of dongles as I usually lose them, but its a minor nit. Good news is that I did get to test the dongles out when I traveled for conferences and they worked great.</p>

<h2>Touch Screen</h2>
<p>Nothing to see here … it’s awesome. Works great. Looks great. Touch points are all excellent.</p>

<h2>Windows 8 Apps</h2>
<p>I tried out several Windows 8 store apps including some games like Toy Story Smash It, Royal Revolt, and Temple Run Brave. These looked and performed great especially with the touch, accelerometer, and gestures! My kids keep trying to take this laptop away from me :)</p>

    <a href="/javascript/uncategorized/2013/09/12/javascript-soup.html">JavaScript Soup</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Are you up an expert on <a href="http://gruntjs.com/" target="_blank">Grunt</a>, <a href="http://bower.io/" target="_blank">Bower</a>, <a href="http://www.angularjs.org" target="_blank">Angular</a>, <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/" target="_blank">Knockout</a>, <a href="http://www.durandaljs.com" target="_blank">Durandal</a>, <a href="http://www.breezejs.com" target="_blank">Breeze</a>, <a href="http://momentjs.com/" target="_blank">Moment</a>, <a href="http://www.toastrjs.com" target="_blank">Toastr</a>, <a href="http://backbonejs.org/" target="_blank">Backbone</a>, <a href="http://fgnass.github.io/spin.js/" target="_blank">Spin</a>, <a href="http://emberjs.com/" target="_blank">Ember</a>, <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">React</a>, <a href="http://www.sencha.com/" target="_blank">Sencha</a>, <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/" target="_blank">Dojo</a>, <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, <a href="http://purecss.io/" target="_blank">Pure</a>, and MintyZebraWaffles.js ? (Okay, that last one was made up.) But don’t worry, I’d wonder about your quality of personal life if you were an expert on all of those :). But I bet you are feeling like I do sometimes where there are so many new JavaScript libraries and frameworks coming out every day (seemingly) that it’s hard to keep up with. Combine that with the rate that some of the popular libraries (let’s agree to call them all libraries here just for the sake of moving forward) come out with new versions is fairly frequent. No waiting years for a new version here!</p>

<p><a href="http://jpapa.me/fotoliapapa" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/fotolia_52214835.jpg" alt="fotolia_52214835" width="512" height="219" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21071" /></a></p>
<blockquote><a href="http://jpapa.me/fotoliapapa" target="_blank">Photo supplied by Fotolia.com.</a></blockquote>

<h2>Wading Through It All</h2>
<p>How do you know which libraries work well together? How do you tell which libraries overlap in functionality. Sometimes you mix and match to complement each other. Other times you fill the gaps yourself. But you’d not want to use Angular with Durandal, for example. They overlap way too much and it wouldn’t benefit you to use both. But you certainly could use a stack that fits well together like HotTowel which uses Durandal (soon I will release HotTowel - Angular too).</p>

<p>My point here is that it can be daunting to try to keep up with everything. And while in my other posts I’ll give more advice on which stacks to use, in this post I’ll try to give you some insight into my warped mind on how I evaluate JavaScript libraries and wade through the JavaScript Soup.</p>

<h2>Advice</h2>
<p>First, I recommend you do not try to keep up with every new library. Be aware of them, sure. But you can’t know everything (or at least I know I can’t know everything). I personally like to be aware of what is out there and investigate ones that fill a gap or interest of mine. I use social media, newsletters, blogs, hallway chatter, and other easy to consume channels to increase my awareness. Awareness is easy, low effort.</p>

<p>For example, I became aware of <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">React </a>recently. I heard it was a presentation framework like Angular, Ember, or Durandal. That alone did not interest me to go further. However, I learned the Facebook team was behind it, which caused me to have more interest in it. So I spent an hour on their site looking it over to learn what it could do and how it was different from the others. I learned enough to know it’s interesting, but stuck a pin in it to come back if time ever allows. I may get back to it (knowing me I will), but I’m not worried in the meantime. If anything, I learned they have a very different perspective on SPA. if you want to <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2013/06/05/why-react.html" target="_blank">learn more about React, check out this “Why” post</a>.</p>

<p>By all means, don’t switch to a new library just because it is new and cool. Have some evaluation criteria that means something to you and creates a return on your investment (ROI).</p>

<h2>Super Important</h2>
<p>When evaluating a library, the amount of time I put into the investigation and the criteria I use depends on the risk to my application. For example, if I am looking at a presentation framework (like Angular, Durandal, or Ember) I expect more from it and will spend more time evaluating it. I’m betting my app on that library so I better be sure it’s a good bet. If I am looking at spin.js or toastr.js which have very specific uses, are very small, easily swappable, and most importantly DON’T affect the critical path of my app, I’ll try it out and not do as much research.</p>

<h2>Evaluation Criteria
Here are a few categories I use to evaluate a library. There are in no particular order and are not equally weighted. You may have others, and some of these may mean little to you, so of course your mileage may vary. The key here is to choose criteria that matters to you. Here is my list:

<ul>
	<li>Quality</li>
	<li>Value</li>
	<li>Extendable</li>
	<li>Integration</li>
	<li>Stability</li>
	<li>Community</li>
	<li>Social Chatter</li>
	<li>Well Tended</li>
	<li>Documentation</li>
	<li>Owner Reputation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quality and Value</h2>
Let's hit each of these here, starting with quality and value. If the library works as advertised, does it at a high level, and adds value to my app then I'm going to check those criteria off as positives. Point blank, the library is a tool and if the tool does its job well, I'm game. It also has to add value ... because it could be high quality but not add value. What? Think about it this way ... assume you are using ES5 and you are looking at a library that helps you create a <code>for</code> loop over an array. That may be of high quality. But it's not adding much value since you can use the ES5 array.forEach() syntax already. And if you are using ES3, you could just use a simple <code>for</code> loop. However, if the library is high quality and provides something you don't already have easily, then that adds value. Something like toastr is an example of this, where you could certainly create your own toast logic, but the time you save in using toastr adds value to me since I can spend that time on other problems (only so much time in the day).

<h2>Extendable</h2>
Can I use this library and extend its features if I want to? This is important if you like what it does but feel you may want to tweak it. This could be through a pull request on GitHub or simply by adding your own customization to it. Remember, JavaScript is inherently extendable, so it is likely that you can extend it. But make sure you can do what you need here. For example, toastr comes with basic CSS for the toasts. you may not like that CSS, so you can extend it and override it with your own. Or maybe create a plug-in for jQuery (probably the most extended library ever).

<h2>Integration</h2>
Does the library play well with others? Can I use it and library X together? This is important if you want to use, for example, Angular and Bootstrap controls. Can you? Yes. Is it easy? It depends on your definition of easy. If you are using Bootstrap with Angular it works very simply if you just use the CSS classes. If you use Bootstrap's JavaScript based controls/widgets, they work great too. But you likely want to use these two via Angular directives, to reduce the JavaScript. After all, directives are a huge selling point of Angular. So can you do this? Yes. There is a Bootstrap UI library that helps you connect these two via directives.

I get a lot of questions (100's) that are phrased like this: 
<blockquote>Can I use library X with library Y? </blockquote>

It is a great question. It is a question you should absolutely investigate if integration is important to you. To me it is very important, because I want the flexibility to use a different library and not upset the universe. You have to decide if it is important to you, and if so, investigate it for the libraries you are choosing.

<h2>Stability</h2>
Is the library stable? Does it have few breaking changes? When the breaking changes occur, do the update the version accordingly and document the changes? Hugely important questions to ask. Many libraries fail on this respect. Some of the best ones are Angular, Knockout, Durandal, and jQuery because they spend a lot of effort to make sure you don't have a bad experience.

If the library is paid, I <del datetime="2013-09-13T14:20:20+00:00">expect </del> <strong>demand </strong>this. No if, ands or buts.

<h2>Community and Social Chatter</h2>
Is there community support behind the library? Do folks watch the repo in GitHub? Do they ask questions on google groups, StackOverflow, and other social channels? Do you see folks speaking on these topics at conferences (or at least including them in their talks)? I'm not saying be a follower, but I am saying that were there is smoke, sometimes there is fire. Keep an eye on it and most importantly, learn from their experiences. You may not want to be first down the road so you can avoid the pits, but certainly don't step in those same pits when you travel that road later.

<h2>Well Tended</h2>
How often do the owners contribute to it? How often do they resolve issues? Do issues sit there forever, uncommented? A stale repo is bad news. No commits, not issues, no watchers, no pull requests could be a sign that you want to avoid that library. Be aware of it. However, just because there are a lot of activity on a repo, it doesn't mean it is awesome. So here you just want to make sure you aren't looking at an inactive library.

<h2>Reputation</h2>
What is the reputation of the team behind it? This is hugely important to me. I know that Angular, Durandal, and Knockout have great minds behind them, both which have experience in this arena. Both keep things up to date. Both know what their tools do well and stick to that plan. Both pay close attention to the community. To me, that speaks volumes. It is foolproof? No. Just because Google runs Angular doesn't mean it will be the bees knees forever. Google (like Microsoft and other big boys) also has a history of moving on. Nothing lasts forever. So if you want a library to last forever, technology is not the space for you :) 

The key here is know who makes it.

<h2>Parting Tips</h2>
You aren't the only one feeling overwhelmed. Seriously. This space is evolving fast. The answer is not to ignore it or wait til it settles down. We work in a fast paced industry. My advice is to take a step back and figure out your channels for raising your awareness and then create your evaluation criteria. I've done it and it has helped me keep from drowning :)

  <h2>
    <a href="/bower/javascript/nuget/toastr/uncategorized/2013/09/11/toastr-2-0-1-released.html">Toastr 2.0.1 Released</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Toastr 2.0.1 is now released. You can grab it while its hot! This release has several minor bug fixes, CSS tweaks, some JavaScript refactoring, and some new features. Of course there are new unit tests for all of these too. There is 1 breaking change that I felt was in the best interest, which is why this is a new major version.</p>

<h2>New Ways to Get Toastr</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/CodeSeven/toastr" target="_blank">Toastr on GitHub</a> </li>
	<li><a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/toastr" target="_blank">Toastr on NuGet</a> using <code> install-package toastr</code></li>
	<li><a href="http://bower.io" target="_blank">Toastr on Bower</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank">Toastr on CDNJS</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="http://codeseven.github.io/toastr/demo.html" target="_blank">Toastr demo page </a>is also updated to show off some of the new features, most notably the animations and close button.</p>

<blockquote>Note: CDNJS may be up to a few days before it is available there.</blockquote>

<h2>Animation Changes (Breaking)</h2>
<p>The following animations options have been deprecated and should be replaced:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Replace <code>options.fadeIn</code> with <code>options.showDuration</code></li>
	<li>Replace <code>options.onFadeIn</code> with <code>options.onShown</code></li>
	<li>Replace <code>options.fadeOut</code> with <code>options.hideDuration</code></li>
	<li>Replace <code>options.onFadeOut</code> with <code>options.onHidden</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>Animation Options (New)</h2>
<p>Toastr will supply default animations, so you do not have to provide any of these settings. However you have the option to override the animations if you like.</p>
<h3>Easings</h3>
<p>Optionally override the animation easing to show or hide the toasts. Default is swing. swing and linear are built into jQuery.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">toastr.options.showEasing = 'swing';
toastr.options.hideEasing = 'linear';</pre>
<p>Using the jQuery Easing plugin (<a href="http://www.gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/">http://www.gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/</a>)</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">toastr.options.showEasing = 'easeOutBounce';
toastr.options.hideEasing = 'easeInBack';</pre>
<h3>Animation Method</h3>
<p>Use the jQuery show/hide method of your choice. These default to fadeIn/fadeOut. The methods fadeIn/fadeOut, slideDown/slideUp, and show/hide are built into jQuery.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">toastr.options.showMethod = 'slideDown'; 
toastr.options.hideMethod = 'slideUp';</pre>
<h2>Close Button (New)</h2>
<p>Optionally enable a close button</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">toastr.options.closeButton = true;</pre>
<p>Optionally override the close button’s HTML.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">toastr.options.closeHtml 
    = '<button><i class="icon-off"></i></button>';</pre>
<p>You can also override the CSS/LESS for <code>#toast-container .toast-close-button</code></p>
<h2>Display Sequence (New)</h2>
<p>Show newest toast at bottom (top is default)</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">toastr.options.newestOnTop = false;</pre>

<p>Thanks to the folks who contributed issues or pull requests to this release including: Ryan Hoffman, Jon Gallant, Jon Fazzaro, Craig Teegarden, Umberto, Raffi, Cesar Vargas, and Prashanfdo. (Sorry for any names I got wrong, I used the github user IDs).</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/durandal/javascript/spa/uncategorized/2013/09/08/upgrading-durandal-to-version-2-0.html">Upgrading to Durandal 2.0</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Recently I upgraded a few projects from Durandal v1.x to <a href="http://durandaljs.com/" target="_blank">Durandal 2.0</a>. I did these before there were any notes on the Durandal site for upgrading so I took a bunch of notes. I was lucky enough that the first conversion was aided with the direct help of <a href="https://twitter.com/EisenbergEffect" target="_blank">Rob Eisenberg</a>, creator of Durandal. Rob has since created a great page in the docs to help you <a href="http://durandaljs.com/documentation/Conversion-Guide/" target="_blank">convert from 1.x to 2 which you can find here</a>. But I also included all of my raw notes in this post. Rob’s is the definitive guide, but hopefully my brain dump may help some of you too :)</p>

<p>Please excuse the grammar below as it was a raw brain dump over the course of an hour.</p>

<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>This section covers all of the structural changes when I moved to Durandal 2.</p>
<h3>Library Location</h3>
<ul>
	<li>All files are now located in the Scripts/durandal folder</li>
	<li>Plugins now include: dialog, history, http, observable, router, serializer, widget</li>
	<li>Transitions are still in their own folder</li>
</ul>
<h3>Observable</h3>
<p>The observable plugin takes any Plain Old JavaScript Object (POJO) and adds observability to it. Works on property by property basis. You can also use the API to subscribe, create computed properties or retrieve the underlying observable.</p>
<h3>RequireJS Setup</h3>
<p>Because Durandal is now moved out of the app, you need a requirejs.config setup:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">requirejs.config({
    paths: { 
        'text': '../Scripts/text',
        'durandal': '../Scripts/durandal',
        'plugins': '../Scripts/durandal/plugins',
        'transitions': '../Scripts/durandal/transitions'
    }
});
</pre>
<h3>RequireJS Changes</h3>
<p>Durandal 2.x assumes no global libraries. It will ship expecting Knockout and jQuery to be defined with requirejs. The .NET templates by default will set them up as standard script libs and then register them with require as follows:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
define('jquery', function () { return jQuery; });
define('knockout', ko);
</pre>
<p>No need to setup requirejs.config paths for this. Developers who wish to pipe everything through require.js now have that capability, but the default .NET starter kit will use the same approach as 1.x.</p>
<h3>main.js</h3>
<p>Remove from main.js <code>app.AdaptToDevice()</code></p>
<h3>Global replaces</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Change paths for durandal plugins from <code>durandal/plugins/router</code> to <code>plugins/router</code></li>
	<li>rename <code>viewAttached</code> to <code>attached</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>router</h3>
<p>Durandal 2 now has its own custom router, removing the Sammy dependency.</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>router.visibleRoutes</code> is now <code>router.navigationModel</code></li>
	<li><code>router.allRoutes()</code> is now <code>router.routes</code> and is just an array</li>
	<li><code>routes</code> no longer have a <code>caption</code> nor <code>setting</code> property</li>
	<li><code>router.navigateTo</code> is now <code>router.navigate</code></li>
        <li>remove sammy.js and update index.html</li>
</ul>
<h3>route array changes</h3>
<ul>
	<li><code>url</code> is now renamed to <code>route</code></li>
	<li>because I use <code>router.makeRelative()</code> I can omit the full path to the <code>moduleId</code>. So <code>moduleId: 'viewmodels/sessions',</code> becomes <code>moduleId: 'sessions'</code></li>
	<li><code>visible</code> is now called <code>nav</code></li>
	<li><code>name</code> is now <code>title</code></li>
	<li>default route is now '' (empty string)</li>
</ul>
<h3>router parameter changes</h3>
<p>Durandal v2.0 now passes in a parameter for each value. Query-string, if present, would be the last parameter.</p>

<p>In 1.2, <code>activate</code> used to pass an object.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">//activate = function (routeData) {
activate = function (id, querystring) {
    //var id = parseInt(routeData.id);
    initLookups();
    return datacontext.getSessionById(id, session);
}
</pre>
<h3>router.replaceLocation</h3>
<p><code>replaceLocation</code> now accepts a url and a second parameter, which is an object literal. We can pass a value for <code>replace</code> and set to true, if we want to replace the route history.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">function goToEditView(result) {
    var url = '#/sessiondetail/' + session().id();
    router.navigate(url, {replace: true});
}
</pre>
<h2>Lifecycle</h2>
<h3>activate</h3>
<p>Activate no longer needs to return a promise and is automatically called for every composed object, without the need for an activator or additional configuration. Can remove <code>return</code> from all <code>activate</code> calls. If you return a promise, it will wait til the promise is done. But if we don’t return a promise, no need to return.</p>
<h3>binding</h3>
<ul>
	<li>formerly known as <code>beforeBind</code></li>
	<li>after <code>activate</code>, and immediately before <code>ko.applyBindings</code> is called</li>
	<li>can also return applyBindings: false</li>
	<li>can return object with instructions</li>

</ul>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">// only this vm's view wont be cached
return { cacheViews: true } 
</pre>
<h3>bindingComplete</h3>
<p>Fires after the binding has happened.</p>
<h3>attached</h3>
<p>Formerly known as <code>viewAttached</code>.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">function attached(view, parent){ ... }
</pre>
<h3>compositionComplete</h3>
<ul>
	<li>New event (almost was called documentAttached)</li>
	<li>Fires whenever the composition that this module is participating in is entirely done (all parents and children compositions)</li>
	<li>Fires from child bubbling up to parent</li>
	<li>Useful for "measurement of an element", such as after the layout has been rendered</li>
	<li>You can also use <code>composition.addBindingHandler</code> to register (or convert) a standard binding handler into one that runs after composition completion.</li>
</ul>
<h3>detached</h3>
<p>New event that fires when the view has been detached from the DOM</p>
<h3>canDeactivate</h3>
<p>Fires before you deactivate a viewmodel, providing an opportunity to cancel. Only present with an activator.</p>
<h3>canActivate</h3>
<p>Fires before you activate a viewmodel, providing an opportunity to cancel.O nly present with an activator</p>
<h3>deactivate</h3>
<p>Fires when a viewmodel is being deactivated. Only present with an activator.</p>
<h3>Activator</h3>
<p>No need to return a promise from activate anymore. You get activate without an activator now, too. Three ways to get an activator:</p>
<ul>
	<li>router</li>
	<li>dialogs</li>
	<li>create and use one your self via <code>activator.create()</code> (formerly <code>viewModel.activator()</code>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Configuring Plugins</h2>
<p>You can now configure plugins prior to <code>app.start()</code>. Some plugins want to do things at start-up, so this helps them. For example <code>app.showDialog</code> and <code>app.showMessage</code> are extended on the app module by including it in the configuration.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">app.configurePlugins({
    router: true,
    dialog: true,
    widget: {
        kinds: ['expander']
    }
});
</pre>
<h2>Router Binding</h2>
<p>Faster, simpler, smaller. New router supports hash change and push-state. Better support for parameterized routes, splats, querystring parameters, and optional parameters. Deep linking supports is improved with custom callbacks and child routers. Lots of events are fired and tons of extensibility. Better support for “not found” routes and custom routing conventions. No SammyJS. Built from scratch with no dependencies outside of Durandal. Split into to modules: history and router. Don’t like our router semantics? Write your own on top of history without having to muck with browser stuff.
<code>ko.bindingHandlers.router</code> gets installed with this plugin.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
<!-- ko router: 
    {transition: 'entrance', cacheViews: true } -->
<!-- /ko -->
</pre>
<p>This is the same thing, just long-hand</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
<!--ko compose: {
         model: router.activeItem,
         compositionComplete: router.compositionComplete,
         attached: router.attached,
         cacheViews:true,
         transition: 'entrance'} -->
<!--/ko-->
</pre>
<p>This is a wrapper around the <code>compose</code> binding and makes binding router content simple.</p>
<h3>Child Routing</h3>
<p>We can nest routes. See examples for details</p>
<h3>Activate Callback</h3>
<p>Parameters come in as a list of parameters. Query-string comes in as the last argument (if present), and is keyed (object literal)</p>
<h3>Mapping</h3>
<p>Pass an array of objects with route, moduleId, title, nav, hash (and any custom data you want). <code>visible</code> is now called <code>nav</code></p>
<h4>Routing Sample</h4>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">define (['plugins/router'], function (router) {
    return {
        router: router, 
        activate: function() {
            router.makeRelative({moduleId: 'viewmodels'});

            router.map([
                { route: '', 
                    moduleId: 'helloindex', 
                    title 'Hello World', 
                    nav: 1},
                { route: '/bye', 
                    moduleId: 'goodbye', 
                    title 'See ya', 
                    nav: 2}
            ]);

            //builds an observable model from the 
            //mapping to bind your UI to
            router.buildNavigationModel(); 

            //sets up conventional mapping for 
            //unrecognized routes
            router.mapUnknownRoutes(); 

            //activates the router
            return router.activate(); 
            // no longer needs a start module
        }
    }
});
</pre>
<h3>Use convention</h3>
<p><code> useConvention</code> has been replaced with <code>router.makeRelative({moduleId: 'viewmodels'});</code></p>
<h3>unknown routes</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">router.mapUnknownRoutes('moduleIdGoesHere'); 
//maps unknown routes to a single module
</pre>
<p>Or pass it a function</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">router.mapUnknownRoutes(function(instruction){
    // custom routing logic to implement 
    // your own conventions. simply configure 
    // the instruction object and the router 
    // will handle it
});
</pre>
<p>You can also define your own conventions. There will be a default (plugin config setting), but can override this.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">router.on('router:route:before-config')
    .then(function (config) {
        config.moduleId = 'viewmodels/' + config.moduleId;
});
</pre>
<h2>Compose</h2>
<p>New features for the compose binding:</p>
<h3>Inline Views</h3>
<p>Can now compose an inline view:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><!-- ko compose: { 
    model: 'viewComposition/inlineModule', 
    mode: 'inline' } -->
    <div>Some inlined view bound against the model.</div>
<!-- /ko -->
</pre>
<h3>Templating Views</h3>
<p>Can replace content inside of a template.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><!-- ko compose: { 
    model: 'viewComposition/inlineModule', 
    mode: 'templated' } -->
    <div data-part="header"><h1>hello world</h1></div>
    <div data-part="footer"><h1>goodbye</h1></div>
<!-- /ko -->
</pre>
<p>Label the data-part attributes to get this, in the child views</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">// In the Child Views
<h2 data-part="header"></h2>
<h2 data-part="footer"></h2>

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>In the past 7 months since I introduced HotTowel as a way to jump-start SPA development, Visual Studio has evolved as have some of the key JavaScript libraries. Today you can now download an updated HotTowel Visual Studio template. I created 2 different templates base don how Visual Studio has evolved: one for Visual Studio 2012 and one for Visual Studio 2013 preview. You can grab them here (and please rate them on the Visual Studio Gallery):</p>

<ul><li>Download the <a href="http://jpapa.me/hottowel12" target="_blank">HotTowel SPA project template for Visual Studio 2012</a> </li>
<li>Download the <a href="http://jpapa.me/hottowel13" target="_blank">HotTowel SPA project template for Visual Studio 2013</a> </li></ul>

<p>If you like these templates, join me in thanking <a href="https://twitter.com/xinqiu" target="_blank">Xinyang Qiu</a> of Microsoft who helped me get through some of the more confusing parts of creating the templates. :)</p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://johnpapa.net/wp-content/images/HotTowelPreview.png" /></p>

<p>Hot Towel creates a great starting point for building a <a href="http://johnpapa.net/spa" target="_blank">Single Page Application (SPA)</a> with ASP.NET. Out of the box you it provides a modular structure for your code, view navigation, data binding, rich data management and simple but elegant styling. It provides everything you need to build a SPA, so you can focus on your app, not the plumbing.</p>
<blockquote>Learn more about building a SPA from <a href="http://johnpapa.net/spa?vsix">my videos, tutorials and Pluralsight courses</a>.</blockquote>

<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>Why the changes? First, Visual Studio evolved with 2013 so I wanted to make sure the templates still worked. There were some changes under the covers that you won;t care about that just make it work in 2013 :)</p>

<p>Second, the the Visual Studio Gallery now works with the MVC and SPA project templates. So I wanted to get it up on the gallery (see the links above).</p>

<p>Third, and most importantly to you, <a href="http://www.durandaljs.com" target="_blank">Durandal </a>and Breeze have evolved. Durandal is now at version 2.0 and has breaking changes from its 1.x predecessor. The changes are all good, but they are still changes. So the new template includes the changes and comments explaining what the Durandal code does. Breeze, Toastr, and the other libraries evolved as well, so I updated those and tested them too. For those wanting Bootstrap v3, you’ll have to wait a little longer … I’ll get to that, but for now I included Bootstrap 2.3.2. But it is coming to HotTowel.</p>

<p>Fourth, I updated <a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/HotTowel/" target="_blank">HotTowel for NuGet</a> (if you don’t want a template, just grab the NuGet package)</p>

<p>And finally, I am working on a similar template for Angular (maybe HotTowel NG ?). Look for this in the coming weeks as I get closer to releasing my next <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com" target="_blank">Pluralsight</a> course.</p>

<p>As always, you can <a href="http://johnpapa.net/hottowel" target="_blank">find all you need to know about HotTowel on my HotTowel landing page</a>.</p>

<h2>Update</h2>
<p>Eventually we should be seeing a more unified “One ASP.NET” approach when creating a project. Scott Hanselman has been a big driver behind this effort. i expect that is one reason why currently in the VS 2013 Preview the ASP.NET templates are now under a <code>Visual Studio 2012</code> folder in the <code>New Project</code> dialog. I am not sure if this will move in the future, but that is my gut feel. For now, if you are running VS 2013 Preview and you cannot find the HotTowel SPA template, refer to my image below to locate it.

    <p>Have you been itching to see a SPA using <a href="http://www.durandaljs.com" target="_blank">Durandal</a> and <a href="http://www.breezejs.com" target="_blank">Breeze</a> without entity Framework on the back end? The inventors of Breeze have answered that call by taking the <a href="http://jpapa.me/spajsps" target="_blank">Code Camper SPA using Durandal and Breeze from my Pluralsight course</a> and swapped out the entire back end so it is now using Ruby on Rails. This is huge as it demonstrates how you can use Breeze in a SPA without relying strictly on the metadata tat Entity Framework (EF) provides. Sure EF makes it darn easy, but it is not the only game in town.</p>

<p>Check out this <a href="http://www.breezejs.com/samples/intro-spa-ruby" target="_blank">article about the Ruby/Durandal/Breeze demo</a> to see it in action and learn more about how the Breeze folks wrote it. <a href="https://github.com/IdeaBlade/Breeze/tree/master/Samples/CCJS-Ruby" target="_blank">Download the CCJS-Ruby source code</a> and run the app yourself.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.breezejs.com/samples/intro-spa-ruby" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.breezejs.com//sites/all/images/ruby/sessions.png" width="610" height="745" class="alignleft" /></a></p>

<p>There is a quick run-down from their site on what they changed from ASP.NET and EF to Ruby. Obviously the back end changed to fit a more natural Ruby feel. The front end changed a little bit to add a Breeze-AJAX request interceptor an an Active Record data service adapter.</p>

<p>I enjoy working with ASP.NET, ASP.NET Web API and Entity Framework among other Microsoft stalwarts. But it’s nice to see practically the same SPA client code with Durandal and Breeze working with  a Ruby back-end. Special kudos to <a href="http://twitter.com/wardbell" target="_blank">Ward Bell</a> for working so hard on this!</p>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>If you are trying to get up to speed on testing, you may want to take this course for a spin. My friend Esteban Garcia has published a course for Pluralsight on testing. Specifically he covers <a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/courses/TableOfContents?courseName=microsoft-test-manager-2012&amp;highlight=esteban-garcia_microsoft-test-manager-2012-m1-introduction!esteban-garcia_microsoft-test-manager-2012-m2-configuration!esteban-garcia_microsoft-test-manager-2012-m3-plan!esteban-garcia_microsoft-test-manager-2012-m4-execute!esteban-garcia_microsoft-test-manager-2012-m5-advanced-execution#microsoft-test-manager-2012-m1-introduction" target="_blank">Microsoft Test Manager 2012 and how to plan, manage, and execute tests with it</a>.</p>

<p>The course takes you through the steps needed to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Configure MTM to gather diagnostic data while you run your test cases</li>
	<li>Setting up test plans, test suites, and test cases</li>
	<li>Execute scripted test cases</li>
	<li>Exploratory tests</li>
	<li>Create action recordings to automate test runs with manual validation</li>
	<li>Use parameter binding to streamline data-entry during testing</li>
	<li>Coded UI Tests to achieve full automation</li>
	<li>Create bugs in TFS and include diagnostic data</li>
	<li>Tester-developer interaction (From MTM and Visual Studio)</li>
	<li>Introduce Lab Management into your testing workflow</li>
</ul>

<p>Esteban used my <a href="http://jpapa.me/spajsps" target="_blank">SPA Jumpstart Code Camper application</a> as his test subject.  He coded some bugs into the application and showed how MTM can help uncover them, and then submit them to the development team with all the data needed to diagnose and fix the bug.  Once the code is fixed, it is deployed as part of an automated build and the code is then available for verification with MTM.  By using action recordings at first and then full automation, you are able to easily go through the steps that found the bug.</p>

<p>This is a great course whether you are just getting started with Microsoft Test Manager or you are an experienced user looking to get the most out of the tool.</p>
