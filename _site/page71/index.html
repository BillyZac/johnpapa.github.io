  <h2>
    <a href="/all/2008/02/01/slingbox-encryption.html">Slingbox Encryption</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I bought a Slingbox recently and have been using it just about everywhere I could to test it out. I&rsquo;ll be posting a review on it soon (stay tuned) but something stuck out at me this weekend. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/07/22/slingbox-encryption-upgrade-limits-functionality/">I read that Sling Media has announced that they will now encrypt their transmission of the data from the Slingbox</a>. You can <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/07/22/slingbox-encryption-upgrade-limits-functionality/">read the article here</a> on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget </a>&hellip; but it sounds like they are doing it to help appease the broadcasters, who have never been thrilled with the idea of placeshifting. </p>
<p>If this is correct, one side effect of this is that <a href="http://www.applian.com/">Applian&rsquo;s&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.applian.com/at-large-recorder/index.php">At-Large Recorder</a> (formerly known as Replay SlingCorder), which records media from a SlingBox to a&nbsp;Windows media file (.asf or .wmv) &nbsp;file may no longer function properly due to this encryption. This product is on my list of products to review, but it appears that&nbsp;At-Large Recorder&nbsp;may have hit a major hurdle with Sling Media&rsquo;s encryption. Applian even put a posting on their web site stating the following &hellip;</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"> <p><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="2">Important News (7/13/06): SlingBox&trade; firmware v1.0.86, currently in beta, will not work with At-Large Recorder due to Sling's decision to add encryption to the stream. Make sure to use firmware v1.0.80 instead.</font></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>All of this is according to what I read in news articles and from the <a href="http://www.applian.com/at-large-recorder/index.php">Applian web site</a>, so I do not claim to know the definitive facts on this issue. However, if you are looking at getting the Replay SlingCorder, i highly recommend doing your own research first with <a href="http://www.applian.com/">Applian</a>.</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/all/2008/02/01/scope_identity-and-identity-demystified.html">SCOPE_IDENTITY() and @@IDENTITY Demystified</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>&lt;FONT face=Tahoma&gt;I’ve run across several applications where the use of IDENTITY values has caused some confusion, specifically in how the @@IDENTITY function operates given external influences. We’ve all likely&nbsp;been faced with how to grab the newly generated IDENTITY value from a SQL Server database table. And there are a 2 popular techniques that accomplish this with SQL Server: </p>
<ol> <li>&lt;FONT face=Tahoma&gt;the @@IDENTITY function <li>&lt;FONT face=Tahoma&gt;the SCOPE_IDENTITY() function</li> <p>&lt;FONT face=Tahoma&gt;They both will return a newly generated ID value but the difference between the 2 is very important. Important enough that you could get back an ID that you did not desire. The @@IDENTITY function returns the last IDENTITY value that was generated in your connection. So if you are running a stored procedure that looks something like this (using the Northwind database):</p>&lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt; <p>CREATE&lt;FONT size=2&gt; &lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt;PROCEDURE&lt;FONT size=2&gt; prRegion_Insert_1</p> <p>@description &lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt;NCHAR&lt;FONT color=#808080 size=2&gt;(&lt;FONT size=2&gt;50&lt;FONT color=#808080 size=2&gt;)</p>&lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt; <p>AS</p>&lt;FONT size=2&gt; <p>&lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INSERT&lt;FONT size=2&gt; &lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt;INTO&lt;FONT size=2&gt; Region &lt;FONT color=#808080 size=2&gt;(&lt;FONT size=2&gt;RegionDescription&lt;FONT color=#808080 size=2&gt;)&lt;FONT size=2&gt; &lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt;VALUES&lt;FONT size=2&gt; &lt;FONT color=#808080 size=2&gt;(&lt;FONT size=2&gt;@description&lt;FONT color=#808080 size=2&gt;)</p>&lt;FONT size=2&gt; <p>&lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SELECT&lt;FONT size=2&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff00ff size=2&gt;@@IDENTITY</p>&lt;FONT size=2&gt; <p>GO</p> <p>&lt;FONT face=Tahoma&gt;Assuming that your database has no other actions that occur between the INSERT statement and the SELECT @@IDENTITY statement, then you will get back the newly created RegionID value for the new Region row. But what if there is n Insert Trigger, for example, on the Region table that inserts a record into another table that also has an IDENTITY column. (Perhaps it does this to audit data.) In this case, the sequence of events would be:</p> <ol> <li>&lt;FONT face=Tahoma&gt;the stored proc fires <li>&lt;FONT face=Tahoma&gt;insert the new region record <li>&lt;FONT face=Tahoma&gt;the trigger fires  <li>&lt;FONT face=Tahoma&gt;the trigger’s code inserts the audit record <li>&lt;FONT face=Tahoma&gt;the stored proc then executes the SELECT @@IDENTITY, which then returns the ID that was created by the last statement, which is the audit table’s ID</li> <p>&lt;FONT face=Tahoma&gt;In this case, the ID returned is the ID value that was created by the insert statement inside of the trigger. You might say that you would never put a trigger on a table that inserts into a table with an IDENTITY column in the first place. And I’d believe you … However … other developers and&nbsp;database administrators may create a trigger in the future that does this. They might not know that you wrote a stored procedure (or series of them) &nbsp;that relies on this situation not occurring. The point is that “stuff” happens (polite way of saying it). </p> <p>&lt;FONT face=Tahoma&gt;&nbsp;</p> <p>&lt;FONT face=Tahoma&gt;So what does SCOPE_IDENTITY() do? It returns the last IDENTITY value generated in the scope. So what is the scope? The scope is a batch of SQL code such as s stored procedure, a trigger, or a user defined function. Using the previous example, the scope is the context of the stored procedure and not anything that gets called indirectly by it such as a trigger. This allows you to grab the last generated ID in the stored procedure, as you likely intended for it to happen. Here is another stored procedure that uses the SCOPE_IDENTITY() to grab the last ID generated in the Region table.</p>&lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt; <p>CREATE&lt;FONT size=2&gt; &lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt;PROCEDURE&lt;FONT size=2&gt; prRegion_Insert_2</p> <p>@description &lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt;NCHAR&lt;FONT color=#808080 size=2&gt;(&lt;FONT size=2&gt;50&lt;FONT color=#808080 size=2&gt;)</p>&lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt; <p>AS</p>&lt;FONT size=2&gt; <p>&lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INSERT&lt;FONT size=2&gt; &lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt;INTO&lt;FONT size=2&gt; Region &lt;FONT color=#808080 size=2&gt;(&lt;FONT size=2&gt;RegionDescription&lt;FONT color=#808080 size=2&gt;)&lt;FONT size=2&gt; &lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt;VALUES&lt;FONT size=2&gt; &lt;FONT color=#808080 size=2&gt;(&lt;FONT size=2&gt;@description&lt;FONT color=#808080 size=2&gt;)</p>&lt;FONT size=2&gt; <p>&lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SELECT&lt;FONT size=2&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff00ff size=2&gt;SCOPE_IDENTITY&lt;FONT color=#808080 size=2&gt;()</p>&lt;FONT size=2&gt; <p>GO</p> <p>&lt;FONT face=Tahoma&gt;Is it magic? Nah. But sometimes the smallest things can have huge impacts on our applications.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/12/default.aspx">December 2006 issue of MSDN Magazine</a>&nbsp;is now posted online. My latest <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/12/DataPoints/">Data Points</a> column discusses development with the SmartPhone (titled &quot;RSS Feeds on a Smartphone&quot;). Here is a excerpt from the article quoted from the introduction:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>This month I will demonstrate how to build a Windows Mobile<sup class="clsSmall">&reg;</sup> 5.0 application that reads RSS feeds and loads them into an ADO.NET DataSet. I will start out by showing how to request an RSS feed from a URL asynchronously and then demonstrate how to read the RSS feed and load it into a DataSet. Next, I will show you how to navigate the DataSet&#39;s hierarchy to find the appropriate data containing each feed&#39;s items. Then I will discuss how to use anonymous delegates to sort the data, how to check for the existence of a field in the RSS data using ADO.NET, and how to use the WebBrowser control to navigate to a URL or display HTML. Finally, I will demonstrate how to deploy the application to a mobile device using a CAB project. The full source code for this sample application is available from the MSDN<sup class="clsSmall">&reg;</sup>Magazine Web site.</em></p>

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I've been using Resharper 2 since it was released and its been getting slower for me. What I mean is when&nbsp;I type the characters do not appear as fast as I type. The wierd thing is that it seems to be getting worse. Today it just go unbearable. i cannot be productive with the huge delay in typing that i am getting right now. I tried builds 248 - 252 for VS.NET 2005 and each one gives me the slowness.</p>
<p>For now,&nbsp;I uninstalled the product until I can do some debugging and/o research with JetBrains. Resharper is an awesome tool and I feel like I am cutting of my right arm and trying to code without it, but it just got to be to darn slow. I'll be contacting them soon to see what else I can try.</p>
<p>So my point for rambling on is to see if any of you have already been down this road with Resharper 2 and to what conclusion you came. How have your experiences been?</p>

    <p>I got my copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0976613220/104-1043296-1707162?v=glance&amp;n=283155">Practical .NET 2 and C# 2</a> about a month ago and with my reading list as it is, I have bouncing around between several books. Some good, some bad and some in between.&nbsp;So I finally got to reading a good chunk of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0976613220/104-1043296-1707162?v=glance&amp;n=283155">Practical .NET 2 and C# 2 </a>by <a href="http://www.practicaldot.net/en2/main.htm">Patrick Smacchia </a>(the 10 first chapters) and it certainly has its moments. So far I have found it to be a very good book that makes may dry topics move very quickly.</p>
<p>The publisher is Paradoxal Press … a virtual unknown in our industry. And I believe this is their first book in the .NET development space. With that said, overall I have no major complaints about how the book is put together. There are several grammatical errors in the book that I believe should have been caught by the editors, but this is a minor issue. </p>
<p>The author, Patrick Smacchia, is a Microsoft MVP and he touches on a wide variety of topics in this book.&nbsp;I as very skeptical at first seeing that the book covers so much of .NET … I was afraid it was another one of those books that discusses everything but at such a high level it leaves you wanting at every turn of the page. This book is over 800 pages and through the first 10 chapters I have found it to be very interesting as it discusses the .NET framework and its foundation. Much of this may be a review to many readers, but I found that I did not want to skip pages to quickly just in case there was something new I could pick up on a topic I was already familiar with. Despite its density,&nbsp;I have found the book fast moving so far. </p>
<p>I like the way the author explains topics, very direct and to the point. He general describes a topic, why the topic is important, where it is useful and then gives examples on who to use it. This is a not a editorial book like some others I have read lately ... the author is more focussed on explaining&nbsp; .NET than he is on amusing the reader. Perhaps this is why it reads so fast.</p>
<p>Up through chapter 10 the book has focussed on the .NET Framework v2 and the basics of objects in .NET. The rest of the book gets more into the features such as generics, ADO.NET, remoting, polymorhpism, inheritance, base classes, and transactions. So far this book strikes me as a good reference to explain how things work in .NET both under the covers and on the surface. This book lacks practical everyday examples on using may features (so far, thru chapter 10) and instead focuses on explaining what the features are, how they work and where they might be used. This is not a flaw of the book but rather a categorization of it. We sometimes buy books as a reference and other times we buy them for specific problems that we want to solve. This book falls in the former category. </p>
<p>I recommend this to any .NET developer who wants to fill in the gaps and get&nbsp;a solid understanding of the .NET Framework v2. For someone who has written all or parts of 8 books I am impressed with Patrick’s ability to keep the topics flowing along at a pace that both maintains the interest of the reader and manages to get deep enough into each topic. Through chapter 10, this book gets 4 stars out of 5 for me.</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/all/2008/02/01/motorola-q-smartphone.html">Motorola Q Smartphone</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I did it ... I admit it. I was one of the many silly people that got hyped up on the just released Motorola Q Smartphone. (It runs the Windows Mobile 5 OS&nbsp; … the Smartphone edition). My contract was up and I was itching for a new phone/pda. I was debating over the Treo 700w, Treo 700p and the Motorola Q. In the end the Q won out with me because of it form factor and phone first mentality. Although, a colleague of mine let me play with his Treo 700w quite a bit (thanks Brian) and i have to admit that there is very little NOT to like about it either.</p>
<p>I have been using this thing for 3 days now and I am very impressed. Oh, it has its quirks, but it is a very impressive phone.</p>
<p>The biggest complaint I have is that it only comes from Verizon … which in my area means no high speed wireless connection. I do not get their EVDO service where I am, but I was surprised to see the standard CDMA network in my area gives me 100k to 200k … so its still snappy enough for the time being. Cingular is better in my area for data, and they were surely get the Q and probably the Treo before the end of 2006 (I don't know for sure, but I would think they would **gulp**).</p>
<p>&lt;IMG src="/photos/jpapa/images/146052/secondarythumb.aspx" border=0&gt;</p>
<p>What drew me too the Q? Well a few of the things are ….</p>
<ul> <li>– It is as thin as the RAZR.&nbsp;I love how thin this thing is! I can slip it in and out of my pocket, no holster required! <li>– It has a QWERTY keyboard. Typing emails on a number pad is just a horrific experience. <li>– It offers the basics for me: email, IM, and phone … and it does them all very well <li>– The phone quality is excellent. This is a phone first and it shows. <li>– It can stream video or TV. Nuff said for the geek in me. <li>– It handles MP3’s and MPEG4 videos quite nicely on a miniSD card.</li> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>What caused my hesitation?</p> <ul> <li>– Motorola is not known for making good Smartphones nor PDA’s. <li>– This phone has been delayed several times. <li>– There is no GSM version … yet <li>– Verizon is expensive with their data plans, IMO <li>– Software for the Smartphone is harder to find than Pocket PC <li>– The Q has a landscape screen. Very cool, but again, less software supports it capably</li> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I’ll discuss more about what I like and what I don’t as I use it. And for those mobile developers out there, you can check out my upcoming “<a href="/blogs/john.papa/archive/2006/06/04/146047.aspx">Smartphone Skills</a>” blog post series.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>&lt;A href="/photos/jpapa/images/146052/original.aspx" target=_blank&gt;
