  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>One of the pleasures of working with Beta products is just when your code is working, you find out a method is renamed, its overloads have changed or sometimes its just plain gone. Its part of the sport of development. Being the geek that I am, I actually enjoy running into this once in a while in Beta. Keeps me on my toes. (OK, I know I’m weird). Anyway, ADO.NET’s <em>SqlParameters.Add(string, object)</em> method is being deprecated in ADO.NET v2.</p>
<p>An interesting blog by &lt;A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jackieg/archive/2005/03/22/395517.aspx" target=_blank&gt;Jackie Goldstein that points out <strong>why </strong>this method is being deprecated in ADO.NET v2. At first I was like "WHAT!", but it makes more sense after you read the reasoning behind it. However, you can still achieve the same old functionality by using the new ADO.NET v2&nbsp;<em>SqlParameters.AddWithValue(string parameterName, object value)</em></p>
<p>I have to say that Pablo Castro and the ADO.NET Team have been excellent at helping explain why certain ADO.NET changes are coming. I certainly appreciate it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kudos to you guys!</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/all/2008/02/01/review-of-dual-monitor-software.html">Review of Dual Monitor Software</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>OK, so it has taken me a long time to give in and join the growing group of developers who use 2 or more monitors. Some of my colleagues have been using them for years and touting the incredible convenience that it is to have 2 monitors. I don’t really have a good reason why I never did it other than the cost of the second monitor. Now that most video cards support dual monitors and the price of LCD panels has come down considerably, I decided to go for it. So I am late to the party. Now I keep my Visual Studio.NET code window up on 1 monitor and the properties, toolbox, task list, solution explorer, and other windows in the second monitor. It really is a huge convenience as I was always fighting for more real estate on my screen for my code windows. </p>
<p>But once you go to dual monitors, you start to notice some things that would really be great features to have. For example, when I switched I noticed that the Windows task bar was only on my primary monitor. I wanted it to be on the second monitor, as well so I could see what minimized windows were on which monitor. Also, to move a maximized window from one monitor to the other monitor I had to un-maximize it, drag it to the other monitor and then re-maximize it. Just a little inconvenient. Then I had some “wants” like having 2 different screen savers and 2 different desktop wallpapers&nbsp;(1 for each monitor).&nbsp;So I went looking for some of the dual monitor software offerings on the web. I found several and I won’t review all of them, but I will review what I felt were good choices in both the free and non-free categories.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-Mon</strong></p>
<p>First for the <strong>free </strong>tool, I downloaded and installed &lt;A href="http://www.mediachance.com/free/multimon.htm" target=_blank&gt;Oscar’s Multi-Monitor task bar. I found this at the MediaChance web site which also offers other applications. One really nice feature is that Multi-Mon will expand the desktop across 3 monitors. Pretty cool if you have 3. Its taken me this long to use 2 (read $$$)and my desk would just be covered if I went to 3, so I did not try this feature. But its nice to know that it supports it. The web site also discusses how you can use 2 video cards to set up a triple monitor setup. Anyway, back to the reason I downloaded it … having the task bar on&nbsp;both monitors. Download was quick, installation was easy, and it worked flawlessly in my trials. It puts a button at the upper right of your windows’ title bar that lets you move the window to the other monitor with a single click. </p>
<p>&lt;P align=center&gt;<img src="/photos/jpapa/images/63228/original.aspx" />&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;The Multi-Mon task bar is gray, like the old Windows 2000 task bar. I did not see a setting to make it look like the Windows XP task bar. It also has a feature called the ClipBoard Extender which traps items that you saved to the clipboard. I wasn’t much for the feature other than that it also allows you to run application. For example, if you type <em>calc </em>in the Clipboard Extender and press the F5 key it will run the Windows Calculator application. Overall this tool worked well and since it is free, it isn’t a bad choice if you want something to extend your task bar across 2 or 3 monitors. However, it did not support having 2 different desktop wallpapers.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt; &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;<strong>UltraMon</strong>&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;The best tool I have seen so far for extending the task bar across 2 or 3 monitors, supporting different screen savers, different desktop wallpapers is <a href="http://www.realtimesoft.com/ultramon/">Realtime Soft UltraMon</a>. This tool has a 30 day trial period and costs $39.95 for a single license. Again the download was quick and the installation was simple. The task bar loaded flawlessly and looks like the Windows XP blue task bar. It has several options that you can configure such as telling it which task bar to put the windows on. Just like Multi-Mon, it puts a button at the upper right of your windows’ title bar that lets you move the window to the other monitor with a single click. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;<img src="/photos/jpapa/images/63229/original.aspx" />&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt; <img src="/photos/jpapa/images/63230/original.aspx" />&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;It also adds another button to the title bar of a window that lets you maximize the windows across both monitors. It also support having a different wallpaper on each monitor (so I get to stare at 2 different photos of my kids). AN it supports having different screen savers on each monitor. Overall, I liked UltraMon better as the few extra features were interesting to me. I will probably buy UltraMon as opposed to using the free Multi-Mon, although both worked well for the basic task bar extension.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;I reviewed a few different tools and these were the best in each free and costly categories that I found. If any of you know of a better tool, please pass it on to me. &lt;/P&gt;</p>

    <a href="/all/2008/02/01/review-follow-up-notes-on-resharper-and-net-refactor.html">Review&#58; Follow-Up Notes on ReSharper and .NET Refactor</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>As&nbsp;<a href="/blogs/john.papa/archive/2005/05/13/63162.aspx">I mentioned in a blog last week</a>, I downloaded two refactoring tools: .<a href="http://www.knowdotnet.com/articles/netrefactorproducthome.html">NET Refactor</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">ReSharper</a>. I had some really horrible experiences with refactoring tools in the past, so I was a bit skeptical going in. It has been a week so here are a few more thoughts about the tools.</p>
<p>While .<a href="http://www.knowdotnet.com/articles/netrefactorproducthome.html">NET Refactor</a> has some nice features, like the how it can move code into regions for you and how it creates a list of regions you can choose form, I found that it just did not have enough features to really make me want or need to use it. In fact, I have uninstalled it already.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">ReSharper</a>&nbsp;has a much more robust feature set and for the first time ever, I am glad that a tool&nbsp;prompts me with occasional tips. I did not know any of the shortcuts that it offers, so the tips have been nice since I did not read the help file. I especially love the Find Usages feature. I click on&nbsp;a variable&nbsp;and it finds every place that it is used. This past week I&nbsp;was tasked with renaming a class. I used ReSharper's Find Usages feature to find all locations that it was used before I went ahead with the refactoring. It was smart enough to find out that it implemented an interface and it asked me if I wanted to find usages of the interface too. Very helpful, indeed! It sure is nice to see where something is used before making a refactoring decision. Measure twice, cut once. I then asked it to rename the class and it went and did so everywhere it was referenced. Since this was used in 7 projects across a solution, this was nice time saver. I especially like how ReSharper analyzes and highlights my code files in places where I have invalid references, redundant “using” statements, and methods which are not called by anything. This tool has saved me a lot of time and pro-actively prevented&nbsp;bugs.</p>
<p>Sounds like a winner so far, huh? I think so. To be fair, it does have some issues, too. My biggest issues with ReSharper so far are how long it takes to load and how much precious RAM it consumes. I loaded my project without ReSharper in about 20 seconds (24 projects in the solution with&nbsp;a ton if references). When I load the project with ReSharper it takes over 90 seconds to load while at analyzes the project and loads its cache. The good side of this is that it is relatively quick to use once it is loaded. But still, taking 90 to 150 seconds to load is a bit of a pain, especially when I open and close project files throughout the day. I also told the tool to show how much memory it consumes. This fluctuates, of course, depending on what I am doing. But it seems to float between 70MB and 130MB of RAM. I have 1GB of RAM which is getting to be tight these days, so this is just something to be aware of. Not a problem, just something to understand if you run with low RAM.</p>
<p>So far I am very pleased with ReSharper and I might just add it to my collection of tools. AT $149, its enough for me to pause but if it continues to be as useful as I have found it thus far, it could pay for itself. I’ve got a few weeks left on my 30 day trial …</p>

You might try doing the following: <br /><br /> &lt;FIELDSET&gt;<span class="myCode">XmlReader oMyXmlReader = oCmd.ExecuteXmlReader(); <br />oDs.ReadXml(oMyXmlReader, XmlReadMode.Fragment); </span>&lt;/FIELDSET&gt; <br /><br />The problem with this code is that when you read the XML fragment the ReadXml method tries to match it against a schema. If it does not find a schema, then it ignores the XML. Your end result might be an empty XML document. One way to solve this is to add a schema to the DataSet. Here is one solution: <br /><br /> &lt;FIELDSET&gt;<span class="myCode">XmlReader oMyXmlReader = oCmd.ExecuteXmlReader(); <br />oDs.ReadXmlSchema(oMyXmlReader ); <br />oDs.ReadXml(oMyXmlReader , XmlReadMode.Fragment); <br />oDs.DataSetName = “myRoot”; </span>&lt;/FIELDSET&gt; <br /><br />Now the schema exists (it was inferred) and all of the fragments can be loaded. If I want to write the XML out to a stream, file or string I might want to wrap the XML fragment inside of a parent node (like “myRoot”) so the XML is a well formatted XML document. To do this, you can use the oft overlooked property DataSetName. <br /></p>

    <p>I was just poking around in <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/default.aspx">Visual Studio.NET 2005 Beta 2</a> and I noticed that in my VB.NET project there is now the option to create build events! This is a feature that I have used a lot in C# WinForm projects to copy my <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/entlib.asp">Enterprise Library</a> configuration files to the targe directory (release or debug). I am glad it is now available in VB.NET (at least in beta 2)!</p>

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I've always wanted to write. I love Tolkien's LOTR, Shakespeare (MacBeth is my favorite ... yeah, I know its dark, but it really grabbed me), Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, Beowulf (very cool monsters), and Homer's the Illiad (The Odyssey is just alright). I knew I was never going to be at that level, and with my career choice being what it is, technical books and magazine articles seemed like a good way to both write and stay in my career path. In fact, I am in the throws of planning a few upcoming technical books. So after 7+ years of writing books, articles, training materials, and presentations on everything from VB to SQL Server to ADO.NET, I've decided to try my hands at a non technical book ... a children's book more specifically. </p>
<p>What spurred this on? Well, I recently (last week) became a father of my 3rd little girl and if there is one thing I have learned is that they love books. My girls have more books that the local library! Ok, well not that many. But still, they read so much. And it isn't just my kids, I hear my friends, cousins, sisters, neighbors, colleagues and just about everyone talk about how their kids love to read or browse picture books. So my point is that the interest is there for good children's books.&nbsp;But why would I write one? Like many parents, I find myself telling stories and making up silly songs for my kids. The stories appear to be well received by my kids .. I know they are biased, but hey ... why can't I? </p>
<p>OK, so I decided to write a children's book. I've got the ideas for a few, I just need to find a publisher and an illustrator (I cannot even draw a stick figure correctly). It's not ADO.NET, C# or SQL Server 2005 ... but it may just be the book that stays on someone's bookshelf for years. Wish me luck!</p>
