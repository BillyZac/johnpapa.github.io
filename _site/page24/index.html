  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Mike Taulty and I hosted a 3.5 hour Silverlight bootcamp at MIX11 this year (Mike will be posting all of the slides and demos on his site soon, including mine. I&rsquo;ll link to it when it is up. For the record, I held him up <img src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/MIX11-Silverlight-Bootcamp-Slides-and-MV_13C1B/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png" alt="Smile" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-style: none;" /> .)</p>
<p>The topic for the last hour of the bootcamp was MVVM and &ldquo;Hooking Up&rdquo;. I demonstrated some quick tips on MVVM concepts and then walked through a scenario where Mike played the designer (who was actually my friend and colleague Arturo Toledo) and I played the developer. This was a real story where where Arturo and I worked through the MVVM demo in a matter of 3 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/MIX11-Silverlight-Bootcamp-Slides-and-MV_13C1B/image_4.png"><img height="315" width="539" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/MIX11-Silverlight-Bootcamp-Slides-and-MV_13C1B/image_thumb_1.png" alt="image" border="0" title="image" style="border-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; background-image: none;" /></a></p>
<p>The deck walks through the fundamentals of MVVM first and why abstraction and design time data are important. Then I begin the story and show how Arturo starts with wireframes, goes to visuals (pure graphics), and then to XAML. In the meantime I build the backend and the front end, using design time data that fits with my runtime data model and services. We collaborate as we go, and the result is that Arturo gives me the final XAML and I spend less than an hour putting it into my project and letting her rip.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be discussing this process and expanding on this demo more in the coming weeks, but for now I wanted to get the basic demo out there along with the slides. So yes, I realize the code is not perfect, the XAMl is not perfect, but that&rsquo;s kind of the point. The back end and the design are solid. There is room for the XAMl to be cleaned up and other views and services to be added. I have since made a much cleaner and more expansive app (more views, viewmodels, navigation, etc), but for now let&rsquo;s stick with the core.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/MIX11-Silverlight-Bootcamp-Slides-and-MV_13C1B/image_2.png"><img height="275" width="541" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/MIX11-Silverlight-Bootcamp-Slides-and-MV_13C1B/image_thumb.png" alt="image" border="0" title="image" style="border-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; background-image: none;" /></a></p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note that I removed all the guitar images and replaced them with the same image. I am working on verifying which images I can distribute in the demo. But in the meantime, all images will look like the same guitar, so don&rsquo;t be alarmed <img src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/MIX11-Silverlight-Bootcamp-Slides-and-MV_13C1B/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png" alt="Smile" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-style: none;" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Requirements for the demo:<br />- Visual Studio 2010 SP 1<br />- SqlServer Ce v4 <br />- Visual Studio 2010 tools for SqlServer Ce v4 <br />- Expression Samples PathListBoxUtils <br />- Silverlight 5 beta<br />- Expression Blend Preview for SL 5<br />- Entity Framework 4.1 (for code first)<br />- MVVM Light</p>

    <a href="/graffiti/orchard/sql%20ce/uncategorized/webmatrix/webpi/2011/04/25/orchardpart1.html">Walking Through the Orchard Part 1 - Setting up a Blog</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I spent some time last week working on converting my blog that you  are reading at <a href="http://johnpapa.net">http://johnpapa.net</a> from Graffiti CMS to Orchard CMS 1.1.3. This post explains pretty much everything I had to do from beginning to end, so it is pretty lengthy. But it should be helpful to anyone moving from Graffiti to Orchard, or for that matter, moving from any blog to Orchard. In fact, after I went through the process once for my main blog, I used these same notes to convert another blog. I plan on 3 parts to this series, which this is the first.</p>

<p>This is Part 1 where I will cover how I used WebMatrix to install orchard and set up its initial settings, setup a theme, install some fundamental modules, and configure them.</p>
<ul><li><a href="/orchardpart1">Walking Through the Orchard Part 1 – Setting up a Blog</a></li>
<li><a href="/orchardpart2">Walking Through the Orchard Part 2 – Conversion from Graffiti</a></li>
<li><a href="/orchardpart3">Walking Through the Orchard Part 3 – BlogML Import</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>NOTE: Quick callout to a few folks who helped me tremendously during this process. Much of what’s written in this series, while depictive of my experiences, is due to the help given by these folks. Because of them I can share this with all of you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>- Drew Robbins had gone through a conversion from WordPress and assisted me with the setup of Orchard, its modules and various questions along the way. He authored the FollowMe module and my theme.

- Sebastien Ros of the Orchard team helped with various key problems I ran into. The biggest of which you’ll find I wrote about in parts 2 and 3 of the series where rewrite rules and content display problems came into play. His quick responses were extremely helpful. He even published a brand new Rewrite Rules module while I was chatting with him, that fixed some of my problems.

-Scott Forsyth, of <a href="http://www.orcsweb.com/">ORCSweb Managed Hosting</a>, and his support team continued to give me the best support I have ever received from a hosting provider by a long stretch. These folks know their stuff, are quick to respond any time of day, and talk to me on my level (no talking down). Point blank: without ORCSweb’s support this would have been a much longer process.</blockquote>
<h2>Web Platform Installer</h2>
<p>Before you get started, I recommend installing the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx">Web Platform Installer</a>. I used it for WebMatrix, SQL Server CE and for Orchard CMS. It’s a quick install and really simplifies the process.</p>
<h2>Setup of Orchard using WebMatrix</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.asp.net/WebMatrix">I used WebMatrix</a> to install Orchard and handle a few other tasks along the way. It really did simplify things so I highly recommend using it. Once installed, I ran WebMatrix and clicked on the button to create a new site from <strong>Web Gallery</strong>. I then search for orchard, entered the new site name (JohnPapa.net) and clicked the <strong>next </strong>button. This took about 15 seconds and I had a site up and running locally.</p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/5df882b575d3_12C4C/image_2.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/5df882b575d3_12C4C/image_thumb.png" alt="image" width="504" height="365" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>The next step is to configure the settings for the site, which I did by clicking the link to the localhost url in WebMatrix. This brings up the new Orchard site’s Get Started page (shown below). I entered the name of the site, chose a user name for the admin user,   and a password. I chose to use a SQL Server CE database for the simplicity and portability of the sdf file. Then I also chose the blog Orchard Recipe type.</p>
<blockquote>NOTE: If you choose SQL CE and want to migrate to SQL Express or SQL Server later you can.</blockquote>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/5df882b575d3_12C4C/image_8.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/5df882b575d3_12C4C/image_thumb_3.png" alt="image" width="504" height="721" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>The recipe gets baked and within seconds the blog is appears in the browser using a default blog template.</p>
<h2>Themes</h2>
<p>Looks and layout are important, so the first place I headed was the Themes gallery. You can get there by going to the Dashboard, selecting the Themes section and selecting the Gallery tab. From here, I looked for themes that fit my idea of a blog. The Super Classic one is not bad.</p>
<blockquote>Note: I am using a custom theme not in the gallery, for now.</blockquote>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/5df882b575d3_12C4C/SNAGHTML24adfc68.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="SNAGHTML24adfc68" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/5df882b575d3_12C4C/SNAGHTML24adfc68_thumb.png" alt="SNAGHTML24adfc68" width="504" height="362" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>Once you find a theme you like, install it. Then click on the Themes / Installed tab and find the theme you want. Then click it’s <strong>Set Current </strong>button. The theme I chose has a side panel on the right where I planned to put my widgets (just like the Super Classic and Classic themes above). You can change themes at any time.</p>
<h2>Orchard Modules</h2>
<p>One of the best parts of Orchard is that they follow the model of many other popular blogs by allowing you to import modules to add functionality. The first thing I recommend doing is adding several key modules from the Orchard Gallery. Easiest way to do this is to go to your new blog’s Dashboard, select Modules, then select the Gallery tab. From here you can search for and install (or download and install) the modules.</p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/5df882b575d3_12C4C/SNAGHTML248594bf.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="SNAGHTML248594bf" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/5df882b575d3_12C4C/SNAGHTML248594bf_thumb.png" alt="SNAGHTML248594bf" width="504" height="221" border="0" /></a></p>
<blockquote>Note: Once you install a module, if there is an update for the module available in the online gallery then an alert will appear in your site in the module section. Nice feature!</blockquote>
<p>I installed most modules right from this page. However, I found it easier to search the <a href="http://orchardproject.net/gallery">http://orchardproject.net/gallery</a> site online in some cases.</p>

<p>Here are the modules I added and some important notes for each:</p>

<blockquote>Note: Once you install the modules there appears to be now way to remove them. However you can disable them. I did this when I tried some modules and found better ones.</blockquote>
<p>There are many more modules, some which I already added and other that I plan to add soon. But these are the core ones I felt I needed just to get my blog up and running, so let’s start here. here are a few special notes regarding setup of some of these modules.</p>

<p><strong>Email Messaging </strong></p>

<p>For the <a href="http://orchardproject.net/gallery/List/Modules/Orchard.Module.Orchard.Email">Email Messaging</a> module I went to the Settings area in the Dashboard and found there were a few new settings sections for the new modules I installed. The Email settings required the sender’s email address, host name, port number, and credential information for my blog’s SMTP server.</p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/5df882b575d3_12C4C/image_6.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/5df882b575d3_12C4C/image_thumb_2.png" alt="image" width="237" height="484" border="0" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Contact Us</strong></p>

<p>Once this module is installed and set up, you’ll need to enable this module as it is disabled by default. Next, I went to the Contact Us section in the Dashboard and I added the recipient user name to be me. Then I went to the Users section in the Dashboard and edited my user, set it as an admin, and set the user’s email address. This was needed for the email modules I used. Without it, the <a href="http://orchardproject.net/gallery/List/Modules/Orchard.Module.EWSNoggin.ContactUs">Contact Us</a> module did not work (as it would not know where to send the messages).</p>

<p>a simple page was available at <a href="/contact">/contact</a> as shown below:</p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/5df882b575d3_12C4C/image_14.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/5df882b575d3_12C4C/image_thumb_6.png" alt="image" width="404" height="279" border="0" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Search</strong></p>

<p>I debated whether including this or not, but since I feel search is pretty important on my site and I am still trying to get it to work I figured I’d share my experience anyway. <a href="http://orchardproject.net/gallery/List/Modules/Orchard.Module.Orchard.Search">Search</a> is a simple module as it allows me to include a widget in the side panel of my site to allow searching of content. It allows you to re-index the content on demand and allows you to select which fields the search will look at. All in all it looked great. In fact, it worked fine for a while but at some point it stopped working and instead of searching it brought up an odd page with search information and comments (like it was a blog post). I won’t go any further one what else it did wrong, but suffice to say I alerted the Orchard team and some folks there are looking into it. Hopefully its just something I did. I’ll report back on this either way.</p>

<p><strong>Widgets</strong></p>

<p>Next I wanted to set up my layout. The theme I chose had some sections filled in with placeholder content, which is nice since it gives you an idea of where things will appear. But of course you’ll want to remove those and add content where you want them to appear.  So I first went to the Widgets section in the Dashboard and removed the content I did not want to appear. Then I started working on my right side panel. For my theme this was the AsideSecond section. Here I added a series of widgets from top to bottom. You can add new widgets, re-adjust the order in which they appear, disable them, edit them, or remove them.</p>

<p>I added a Search widget here first, but later disabled it as it was not working consistently for me. I could have removed it, but again, I plan to put this back in later.</p>

<p>I then added an Html Widget which is great for adding any HTML content. In this case I added a small headshot of me and a few tiny images I wanted to appear on top. Next I added the Follow Me widget, then the Twitter widget, followed by a series of Html widgets for other content.</p>

<p><strong>FollowMe</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://orchardproject.net/gallery/List/Modules/Orchard.Module.Drewby.FollowMe">FollowMe</a> module was written by Drew Robbins and is a clean and simple module that adds something like this image:</p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/5df882b575d3_12C4C/image_10.png"><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/5df882b575d3_12C4C/image_thumb_4.png" alt="image" width="244" height="68" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>When I added the widget, I edited its settings by entering the Twitter Url, Facebook Url, Rss Url, and Flickr Url. You can also add one for email and YouTube. I left these latter 2 blank, which made the widget not display them (which is what I wanted).</p>
<blockquote>Note: You can add a title to the widgets, but I generally avoid this as I think it adds clutter to the panel.</blockquote>
<p>Notice the widgets in the image below are displayed in gray when disabled. Also notice that many of the widgets say Html Widget (their type). I would prefer that I could add a title but mark it as hidden. This would allow me to see the name of the widget in the dashboard instead of seeing a ton of Html Widget types.</p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/5df882b575d3_12C4C/image_12.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/5df882b575d3_12C4C/image_thumb_5.png" alt="image" width="504" height="716" border="0" /></a></p>
<h2>LatestTwitter</h2>
<p>I tried a few of the Twitter widgets and there are several nice ones. The one I ended up with is a simple widget with few features called <a href="http://orchardproject.net/gallery/List/Modules/Orchard.Module.LatestTwitter">LatestTwitter</a>. I like it because its pretty basic and does what I need yet allows me to customize the appearance.</p>
<blockquote>Note: There is also a widget called <a href="http://orchardproject.net/gallery/List/Modules/Orchard.Module.Twitter">Twitter</a> which allows you to create a scrolling list of tweets, shows searches, and much more. I installed it and it works nice. I just did not need that for now.</blockquote>
<h2>Coming in Part 2 … Walking Through the Orchard Part 2 – Conversion from Graffiti</h2>
<p>In Part 2 of this series I will walk through the export from Graffiti to BlogML and the import process from the BlogML file I created and all of the tweaks I made during the conversion. This included the import process, rewrite rules, and fixes due to conversion problems.</p>
<h2>Coming in Part 3 … Walking Through the Orchard Part 3 – Fixes, Tips, and Performance</h2>
<p>Then in Part 3 I’ll hit a few other changes I made and cover some tips and tricks. These included database migrations, webdeploy tips, IIS 6 and IIS 7 differences, content display problems, and performance.</p>

You get Open Source Fest! <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnpapa/sets/72157626548554856/detail/">Check out the photos our photographer took at Open Source Fest here on Flickr</a>.  <p>Last week we hosted the Open Source Fest event at MIX11. You can check out <a href="/osfmix11list">the pre-event post on Open Source Fest</a> I did to see all <strong>52</strong> of the projects who signed up to present their projects.  <p>Nearly 500 people attended Open Source Fest, many of whom stuck around for the entire event from 6pm to 9pm. The best barometer of the success of the event to me was that each open source station was packed all night long with people interested in learning about the projects. Seriously! I was glad I made an effort prior to the event to walk around and thank the open source leaders for coming because once the event started it was practically impossible for me to get their time since they were so busy sharing with the attendees.  <p>If you want to follow the open source leaders, you can <a href="http://twitter.com/John_Papa/osfmix11">follow this twitter list I created for the presenters at Open Source Fest</a>.  <p>So who won?  <p>All voting was close for both the community vote and the judge’s panel. <a href="http://motionfx.codeplex.com/">The Judge’s Panel Award went to Josh Blake and his InfoStrat.MotionFx project</a>. The <a href="http://restsharp.org/">People’s Choice Award went to John Sheehan’s RestSharp project</a>. But the real winners were all of the projects. The voting mechanism was also a really cool way for me to inspire folks to go to each table (which seemed to work).  <p>What would I do differently next time? First, I’d get a larger room and pre-order more food! We almost ran out of food 3 times and each time the MIX11 team authorized more right on the spot. Kudos to the team for covering this and to Mandalay for being on top of this and alerting me. I’d also change the entertainment as it was a bit too loud to have quality conversations. We lowered the volume throughout the evening and lessened the number of times they performed, but it was a good learning lesson. I’d also make sure the signs were a bit larger on the tables so folks could easily see them and I have a bunch of other great learnings too that will all help make it even better next time. Overall, it was a great 1st time for the event.  <p>Will we do it again? I certainly hope so. The event was a success and it certainly helps that the feedback was plentiful and extremely positive. I know if I am involved in the next event planning I’ll be proposing it (I was “on loan” to the MIX11 team). I love hosting events that support networking, socialization, and creative discussion (UX Lightning, Firestarters, Open Source Fest, MIXer, etc). Jennifer Ritzinger and Mike Swanson deserve a ton of credit for being 100% supportive of the event. They allowed me the freedom to try something new that was entirely for the attendees. Also, a huge thanks goes out to Joan Hoshino and Sara Gavin of Realtime Productions, who helped pull my crazy ideas together and make it all work.  <p>Most of all, thank you to everyone who showed up either to present or attend. I’m glad I got to meet so many of you for a great kickoff event to MIX11.

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Now that I am back from MIX11, I&rsquo;ll be blogging about my experiences and what struck me most. For starters, I wanted to share special &ldquo;thank you&rsquo;s&rdquo;&nbsp; to everyone who was involved in UX Lightning. This was one of the most fun events I have ever been involved with pulling together!</p>
<p>First, thank you to the hundreds of attendees who packed the rooms with over 420 people for each of the 3 UX Lightning sessions at MIX11. Wow, what an amazing turnout for 12 brilliant presenters!</p>
<p>I also want to thank all 12 presenters for putting on what was one of the highlights of MIX11 for many of the attendees! Here they all are, with their Twitter links &hellip; be sure to follow them all! (And don&rsquo;t forget to follow me too <img src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/Windows-Live-Writer/Lightning-Strikes-at-MIX11-UX-Lightning_10928/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png" alt="Smile" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-style: none;" />&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/john_papa">@john_papa</a>)</p>

</ul>
<p>UX Lightning was VERY well received, with each session &ldquo;selling out&rdquo;! Each session was packed by the time it started and folks were not allowed in once full until someone left. This caused a line to appear outside of each session! Scores were excellent but more importantly and the room was packed, but most importantly, the buzz around you&rsquo;re the sessions were extremely high and positive. I sat in on the sessions and what struck me most of all was that the entire audience was extremely attentive, eyes up on stage, and taking notes. The presenters OWNED that stage.</p>
<p>Prelim scores and comments are out for the&nbsp; sessions and they are all excellent.</p>
<p>Also &hellip; a special thank you to our MIX11 organizers, <a href="http://twitter.com/Ritzy">Jennifer Ritzinger</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/anyware">Mike Swanson</a>, for being extremely supportive of UX Lightning. And to Janet, our speaker manager, for making sure it went off as smoothly as it did <img src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/Windows-Live-Writer/Lightning-Strikes-at-MIX11-UX-Lightning_10928/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png" alt="Smile" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-style: none;" /></p>

    <p>Paul Stubbs, of <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/SharePointSideshow">Sharepoint Sideshow</a>, <a href="http://jpapa.me/sltv68">joins John to discuss some new features the Sharepoint team have released for Visual Studio to make Silverlight development easier</a>.

    <p><a href="http://jpapa.me/sltv67">This week on Silverlight TV</a> &hellip; Recently, UX legend Bill Buxton was in town and stopped by to share what he's been up to. In this video, he discusses how integrated devices with things that "just work together," UX, and touch might all be in our lives to a much larger degree in the near future.

    <p>Struggling with using bit.ly or logging on Windows Phone 7? Then you might want to learn about Phoney, a new open source project by Shawn Wildermuth that will be at <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/OpenSourceFest">Open Source Fest at MIX11 on April 11th</a>. Shawn walks through the features that Phoney contains, including his Bitly helper, system resource helper, fading message helper, phone logging, and more. Shawn and John inspect the API and show how easy it is to use, as well as the results you get from coding with these features. These are great utilities in a tiny dll that can really shorten the development time for some pretty common scenarios with Windows Phone 7. You can get Phoney from codeplex and it works with Nuget, too.</p>

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Mike Taulty and I are on the road again at MIX11 next month for a reprisal of our Silverlight bootcamp. Last year we had a full house and discussed Silverlight 3 … hard to believe that was a year ago!This year we’ll be talking about Silverlight 4 and 5. We’ve decided to shake things up a bit this year and talk about topics that we feel that are crucial to building solid apps with Silverlight. Me being the data guy at heart, of course this involves solid practices for data access, binding, validation, templating with data, retrieval of data, REST, WCF, LINQ, serialization, isolated storage, OData, RIA Services, and visualizations of data. Probably much more, but I think you get the idea. </p>
<p>Mike and I will spend time not talking about the data so much as we will be talking about how to use it properly to get some great effects. Most if not all apps need data, but once you get it how do you make it shine? How do you accept data? How do you create visualizations with it? Where does Blend come in? We’ll talk about a lot of this and discuss how some of the features of Silverlight 5 make this easier and more robust.</p>
<p>Of course, any talk around solid application architecture done by me always involves some patterns. With Silverlight I like to use MVVM … so our bootcamp will also provide a great guide on how to tackle MVVM with Silverlight for the desktop and Windows Phone 7. I’ve been tossing some ideas around how to build a demo with and without MVVM to show the differences side by side. Some of this might be in the talk, but certainly I will include lots of MVVM topics including how to get started … and most importantly, how to solve programming problems with MVVM and other patterns. I don’t choose patterns to be cool, I choose patterns to solve real problems. And if they don’t solve a problem, I don’t use it. Simple as that. But we won’t just be talking basics, there will be plenty of common real world problems we solve with patterns in this bootcamp.</p>
<p>What we hope folks will walk away with is an understanding of how to make your <strike>dog </strike>data jump, roll over, and speak. Attendees will&#160; also walk out with a solid understanding of how to get going with MVVM and how to solve real common problems with patterns. </p>
<p>Mike and I really enjoyed last year’s bootcamp. We tried to keep it lively, fast paced, and fun. And we have some great give aways for those who come early … first come first serve!</p>
<p>BTW - If you have already registered for MIX, you can still <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/">go back to your registration and register for our Silverlight bootcamp</a>. </p>

    <a href="/silverlight/2011/03/16/upgrading-to-entity-framework-4-1-rc.html">Upgrading to Entity Framework 4.1 RC</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Entity Framework 4.1 RC is out and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/adonet/archive/2011/03/15/ef-4-1-release-candidate-available.aspx">the team has a great post on what’s included</a> and how to get the bits. I am working on a project using them so I upgraded my code and found a few things that I thought I’d pass along as some tips. Some are more obvious, others might be more special cases that I hit. But either way, it was pretty simple. The entire process took me about 20 minutes, and I was able to walk my colleagues through it in about 5 minutes (typing over Skype).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Upgrading to EF 4.1 RC – 10 Second Overview</h3>
<ol> <li>Typed <strong>uninstall-package EFCodeFirst </strong>in the NuGet console  <li>Typed <strong>install-package EntityFramework </strong>in the NuGet console  <li>Updated a few lines of code for some breaking changes from CTP 5 to RC </li> <h3>1. Uninstall Entity Framework 4.1 CTP 5</h3> <p>First, grab <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/27077b70-9dad-4c64-adcf-c7cf6bc9970c/">NuGet from here</a>. </p> <ol> <li>The first step is to open the NuGet Package Manager Console by opening the menu:  <ul> <li>View –&gt; Other Windows –&gt; Package Manager Console </li></ul> <li>Make sure the correct project is selected in the drop down (mine is AccoutnsAtAGlance.Model, shown in the figure below)  <li>Type <strong>uninstall-package EFCodeFirst </strong>and click ENTER<a> </a></li> <p>Alternatively, you could use the UI to uninstall NuGet packages. Here are the alternate steps:</p> <ol> <li>Right click your project and select <strong>Add Library Package Reference </strong> <li>Select <strong>Installed Packages </strong>in the left menu  <li>Click the <strong>Uninstall </strong>button next to the EFCodeFirst package </li> <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/Windows-Live-Writer/94cfa2bb161e_13580/SNAGHTML545f5af.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: left; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="SNAGHTML545f5af" border="0" alt="SNAGHTML545f5af" align="left" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/Windows-Live-Writer/94cfa2bb161e_13580/SNAGHTML545f5af_thumb.png" width="576" height="252" /></a></p> <h3>2. Install Entity Framework 4.1 RC via NuGet</h3> <p>You can install EF 4.1 RC via a regular download installer, but NuGet is so easy. </p> <ol> <li>The first step is to open the NuGet Package Manager Console by opening the menu:  <ul> <li>View –&gt; Other Windows –&gt; Package Manager Console&nbsp; </li></ul> <li>Make sure the correct project is selected in the drop down (mine is AccoutnsAtAGlance.Model, shown in the figure below)  <li>Type <strong>install-package EntityFramework </strong>and click ENTER<a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/Windows-Live-Writer/94cfa2bb161e_13580/image_2.png">&nbsp;<img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: left; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" align="left" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/Windows-Live-Writer/94cfa2bb161e_13580/image_thumb.png" width="528" height="122" /></a> </li> <p>Alternatively, you could use the UI to add NuGet packages. Here are the alternate steps:</p> <ol> <li>Right click your project and select <strong>Add Library Package Reference </strong> <li>Select <strong>Online </strong>in the left menu  <li>Type <strong>EntityFramework</strong> in the search box  <li>Click the <strong>Install </strong>button </li> <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/Windows-Live-Writer/94cfa2bb161e_13580/SNAGHTML538d0c1.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: left; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="SNAGHTML538d0c1" border="0" alt="SNAGHTML538d0c1" align="left" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/Windows-Live-Writer/94cfa2bb161e_13580/SNAGHTML538d0c1_thumb.png" width="595" height="307" /></a></p> <h3>3. Tips</h3> <ul> <li>TIP 1 - I use Resharper and for some reason Resharper did not keep up with the changes. It the new API changes in red, even though the project was building. To resolve this you can either force Resharper to refresh its cache or the easiest thing to do is to close your solution and reopen it.  <li>TIP 2 - Where I invoke Stored Procedures (which I admit is rare) I had to change the call from the commented out code to the code below it. The SqlCommand method was renamed ExecuteSqlCommand, which is more of a verb anyway <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/Windows-Live-Writer/94cfa2bb161e_13580/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png" /> </li> <div style="border-bottom: silver 1px solid; text-align: left; border-left: silver 1px solid; padding-bottom: 4px; line-height: 12pt; background-color: #f4f4f4; margin: 20px 0px 10px; padding-left: 4px; width: 97.55%; padding-right: 4px; font-family: 'Courier New', courier, monospace; direction: ltr; height: 40px; max-height: 200px; font-size: 8pt; overflow: auto; border-top: silver 1px solid; cursor: text; border-right: silver 1px solid; padding-top: 4px" id="codeSnippetWrapper"><pre style="border-bottom-style: none; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 0px; line-height: 12pt; background-color: #f4f4f4; margin: 0em; border-left-style: none; padding-left: 0px; width: 100%; padding-right: 0px; font-family: 'Courier New', courier, monospace; direction: ltr; border-top-style: none; color: black; border-right-style: none; font-size: 8pt; overflow: visible; padding-top: 0px" id="codeSnippet"><span style="color: #008000">//return base.Database.SqlCommand("DeleteAccounts");     </span><br />return <span style="color: #0000ff">base</span>.Database.ExecuteSqlCommand(<span style="color: #006080">"DeleteAccounts"</span>);</pre><br /></div>
<ul>
<li>TIP 3 - The ModelBuilder object was renamed to DbModelBuilder. So this code changed, too:
<div style="border-bottom: silver 1px solid; text-align: left; border-left: silver 1px solid; padding-bottom: 4px; line-height: 12pt; background-color: #f4f4f4; margin: 20px 0px 10px; padding-left: 4px; width: 97.5%; padding-right: 4px; font-family: 'Courier New', courier, monospace; direction: ltr; max-height: 200px; font-size: 8pt; overflow: auto; border-top: silver 1px solid; cursor: text; border-right: silver 1px solid; padding-top: 4px" id="codeSnippetWrapper"><pre style="border-bottom-style: none; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 0px; line-height: 12pt; background-color: #f4f4f4; margin: 0em; border-left-style: none; padding-left: 0px; width: 100%; padding-right: 0px; font-family: 'Courier New', courier, monospace; direction: ltr; border-top-style: none; color: black; border-right-style: none; font-size: 8pt; overflow: visible; padding-top: 0px" id="codeSnippet"><span style="color: #008000">//protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)</span><br /><span style="color: #0000ff">protected</span> <span style="color: #0000ff">override</span> <span style="color: #0000ff">void</span> OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)</pre><br /></div></li></ul>
<ul>
<li>TIP 4 - The extension methods MapLeftKey and MapRightKey also changed their overloads. So I had to change this many to many mapping from the commented out code to the code below it. Basically, the lambdas were pretty redundant in CTP 5. </li></ul>
<div style="border-bottom: silver 1px solid; text-align: left; border-left: silver 1px solid; padding-bottom: 4px; line-height: 12pt; background-color: #f4f4f4; margin: 20px 0px 10px; padding-left: 4px; width: 97.5%; padding-right: 4px; font-family: 'Courier New', courier, monospace; direction: ltr; max-height: 200px; font-size: 8pt; overflow: auto; border-top: silver 1px solid; cursor: text; border-right: silver 1px solid; padding-top: 4px" id="codeSnippetWrapper"><pre style="border-bottom-style: none; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 0px; line-height: 12pt; background-color: #f4f4f4; margin: 0em; border-left-style: none; padding-left: 0px; width: 100%; padding-right: 0px; font-family: 'Courier New', courier, monospace; direction: ltr; border-top-style: none; color: black; border-right-style: none; font-size: 8pt; overflow: visible; padding-top: 0px" id="codeSnippet"><span style="color: #008000">//modelBuilder.Entity&lt;WatchList&gt;().HasMany(w =&gt; w.Securities)    </span><br /><span style="color: #008000">// .WithMany()     </span><br /><span style="color: #008000">// .Map(map =&gt; map.ToTable("WatchListSecurity")     </span><br /><span style="color: #008000">// .MapRightKey(s =&gt; s.Id, "SecurityId")     </span><br /><span style="color: #008000">// .MapLeftKey(wl =&gt; wl.Id, "WatchListId")); </span><br />modelBuilder.Entity&lt;WatchList&gt;().HasMany(w =&gt; w.Securities)<br />       .WithMany()<br />       .Map(map =&gt; map.ToTable(<span style="color: #006080">"WatchListSecurity"</span>)<br />       .MapRightKey(<span style="color: #006080">"SecurityId"</span>)<br />       .MapLeftKey(<span style="color: #006080">"WatchListId"</span>));</pre><br /></div>
<ul>
<li>TIP 5 – This one was weird, I admit. For some reason I had to map a model named Security to the table Securities. In CTP 5 this was not necessary, but in the RC I was receiving an error about the mapping for the model Security was not found. Once I added this, all was well. I’ve brought this to the team’s attention as I hope its just something I am doing wrong. If so, I will update this post to clarify it based on what the EF team says. </li></ul>
<div style="border-bottom: silver 1px solid; text-align: left; border-left: silver 1px solid; padding-bottom: 4px; line-height: 12pt; background-color: #f4f4f4; margin: 20px 0px 10px; padding-left: 4px; width: 97.5%; padding-right: 4px; font-family: 'Courier New', courier, monospace; direction: ltr; max-height: 200px; font-size: 8pt; overflow: auto; border-top: silver 1px solid; cursor: text; border-right: silver 1px solid; padding-top: 4px" id="codeSnippetWrapper"><pre style="border-bottom-style: none; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 0px; line-height: 12pt; background-color: #f4f4f4; margin: 0em; border-left-style: none; padding-left: 0px; width: 100%; padding-right: 0px; font-family: 'Courier New', courier, monospace; direction: ltr; border-top-style: none; color: black; border-right-style: none; font-size: 8pt; overflow: visible; padding-top: 0px" id="codeSnippet">modelBuilder.Entity&lt;Security&gt;().ToTable(<span style="color: #006080">"Securities"</span>);</pre><br /></div>
<ul>
<li>TIP 6 – This is an API change for the better. The ProxyCreationEnabled property is now a member on the DbContext.Configuration object, so the code went from the commented out code to the code below it. In CTP 5 I had to cast the DbContext variable to IObectContextAdapter and then use the ObjectContext.ConextOptions to get to the property I wanted. Yuck. In EF 4.1 RC I can access both the ProxyCreationEnabled and LazyLoadingEnabled properties off the DbContext.Configuration object. </li></ul>
<div style="border-bottom: silver 1px solid; text-align: left; border-left: silver 1px solid; padding-bottom: 4px; line-height: 12pt; background-color: #f4f4f4; margin: 20px 0px 10px; padding-left: 4px; width: 97.5%; padding-right: 4px; font-family: 'Courier New', courier, monospace; direction: ltr; max-height: 200px; font-size: 8pt; overflow: auto; border-top: silver 1px solid; cursor: text; border-right: silver 1px solid; padding-top: 4px" id="codeSnippetWrapper"><pre style="border-bottom-style: none; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 0px; line-height: 12pt; background-color: #f4f4f4; margin: 0em; border-left-style: none; padding-left: 0px; width: 100%; padding-right: 0px; font-family: 'Courier New', courier, monospace; direction: ltr; border-top-style: none; color: black; border-right-style: none; font-size: 8pt; overflow: visible; padding-top: 0px" id="codeSnippet"><span style="color: #008000">//return ((IObjectContextAdapter) _DataContext)</span><br /><span style="color: #008000">//.ObjectContext.ContextOptions.ProxyCreationEnabled = false; </span><br /><span style="color: #0000ff">return</span> _DataContext.Configuration.ProxyCreationEnabled;</pre><br /></div>
