    <p>My father's family migrated to America from Italy in the early 1900's. Specifically, they came from the town of Castiglione in Sicilia. I have seen some incredible photos of the volcano that happens to be the next door neighbor to Castiglione , but with today's mapping tools it is pretty compelling to see how close Mt Aetna truly is. Check out this photo ... notice the dark green spot to the southwest o the green arrow? That is Mt Aetna. The green arrow is Castiglione.</p>

    <p>No that's not a typo in the title ... it's my poor attempt at dry humor :)</p>
<p>I have had several questions from people over the past few months regarding my noticeable sparseness in blogging at <a href="http://www.codebetter.com">www.codebetter.com</a>, my blogging home for the past 3 years. The truth is that it took me a while to get back to setting up my new blogging home at <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net">www.johnpapa.net</a> . I used the various beta versions of <a href="http://www.graffiticms.com">Graffiti CMS</a> to get it started and then I recently migrated the site over to the release version of Graffiti. I must say that <a href="http://www.graffiticms.com">Graffiti</a> is perfect for my needs. I can consolidate my posts, organize my events, articles, and add some ASP.NET and SilverLight aspects, too. </p>
<p>So what will you find on <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net">www.johnpapa.net</a> ? You will find my usual technical posts as well as a listing of all of the articles I have published (the books listing is not there yet) and all of the events I will be speaking at as they get scheduled and confirmed.</p>
<p>Will I still post to <a href="http://www.CodeBetter.com">www.CodeBetter.com</a> ? Yes, I will still cross post some content to <a href="http://www.CodeBetter.com">www.CodeBetter.com</a> but the superset of the posts will be on <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net">www.johnpapa.net</a> including technical content, reviews, and opinions.</p>
<p>So please add my new site <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net">www.johnpapa.net</a> to your aggregated feed&nbsp; list <a title="http://feeds.feedburner.com/JohnPapa" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/JohnPapa">http://feeds.feedburner.com/JohnPapa</a>.</p>
<p>I'll be at <a href="/all/next-up-orlando-devconnections/">DevConnections</a> this coming week in Orlando, so if you are going to be around please stop by <a href="/all/next-up-orlando-devconnections/">one of my sessions on windows mobile development, LINQ, the Entity Framework or SQL Server Reporting Services</a> and say hi!</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/all/2008/04/19/entity-framework-setup-installation-fun.html">Entity Framework Setup - Installation Fun!</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Yeah, I know its expected that when a product is in beta and its ancillary features are released in a CTP that there will be some "interesting" issues in getting set up. But its getting a bit out of control (in a good way) lately with all of the installations related to the Entity Framework. I had not noticed much until this weekend as I am preparing my laptop for my sessions at DevConnections in Orlando next week.</p>
<p>Here is the list of installations that I had to go through just to get the Entity Framework up and running:</p>
<ul> <li>Key Entity Framework Bits</li> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=15DB9989-1621-444D-9B18-D1A04A21B519&amp;displaylang=en">Entity Framework Beta 3</a>&nbsp;</li> <li>VS 2008 KB 945282 Patch</li> <li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=D8AE4404-8E05-41FC-94C8-C73D9E238F82&amp;displaylang=en">EDM Designer Tools CTP 2</a></li></ul> <li>Extras</li> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=A9C6BC06-B894-4B11-8300-35BD2F8FC908&amp;displaylang=en">ASP.NET Extensions Preview</a></li> <li><a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/EFExtensions">Entity Framework Extensions</a></li> <li><a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/entitybag/">EntityBag code (aka Perseus)</a></li></ul> <li>Tools</li> <ul> <li><a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/EFMappingHelper">EF Mapping Helper</a></li> <li><a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/esql">eSqlBlast</a></li></ul> <li>Samples</li> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=8bdaa836-0bba-4393-94db-6c3c4a0c98a1&amp;displaylang=en">VS 2008 and .NET 3.5 Training Kit</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/adonetsamples/">Entity Framework Beta 3 Samples</a></li></ul></ul>
<p>There are the bits themselves, then there are several extras from the Data Team which are very useful. Then there are the tools such as the Mapping Helper (very cool indeed) and eSqlBlast (very cool helpful writing Entity SQL). Finally, there are a few examples that are nice to walk through. of course, then there are the dozens of example projects I have built that I need to migrate to my laptop.</p>
<p>Over time these don't seem like much but when I had to install all of these today it struck me on how much is going into the Entity Framework and from so many sources!. I love this stuff!</p>

    <a href="/all/2008/04/19/promising-quot-update-model-quot-feature-additions-in-next-edm-release.html">Promising "Update Model" Feature Additions in Next EDM Release</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>If you have tried the "Update Model from Database" feature in the Entity Framework's EDM tool (latest version is the EDM CTP 2) you probably have noticed that it currently does not fully update the DB model as well as you hoped. I know I got excited when I first saw the feature, but quickly had a let down as I knew I had to wait til the next release to get more out of this feature. This month <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/adonet/archive/2008/04/01/update-model-from-db.aspx">Noam Ben-Ami gave us a preview of some of the new features that will be in the next release of the EDM</a>. You definitely want to check this out.</p>
<p>I am thrilled to see that the Update Model from Database feature will not remove items from the conceptual model. Though instead of simply showing errors, I would not mind it asking me with some type of wizard that prompts me with suggestions. For example, when a column has been removed from a table in the database it would be awesome if a list of issues was presented and along with options to take action (such as remove property from the entity and refactor). yeah, yeah, I know its being picky :) </p>
<p>I also love how its smart enough to detect that a hierarchical relationship in the conceptual model may represent multiple tables in the the database.&nbsp; Its getting much closer!!!</p>

    <p>I've been using the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsimmons/archive/2008/01/20/entitybag-part-ii-modes-and-constructor.aspx">EntityBag concept that Danny Simmons has been posting</a> for a while now. One of the neat aspects of the EntityBag is its automatic mode settings. As I was explaining this to someone this week (as a precursor to my 2 Entity Framework DevConnections talks next week in Orlando), it occurred to me to create a small table explaining the highlights of the modes. So here is the 20,000 foot view of the modes of an EntityBag. You can find <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsimmons/archive/2008/01/20/entitybag-part-ii-modes-and-constructor.aspx">more about the EntityBag and its modes on Danny's blog</a>.</p>

    <p>I've been downloading a new set of <a href="http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/ReSharper/ReSharper+4.0+Nightly+Builds">EAP bits for ReSharper 4</a> once a week since they opened access to the nightly builds and it really its coming together. The latest bits are much more stable than earlier versions and the features that are implemented are getting very close to being complete. </p>
<p>ReSharper v3 is in full release but does not support some of .NET 3.5 and VS.NET 2008's best features. Here is a <a href="http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/ReSharper/ReSharper+4.0+Roadmap">roadmap that I grabbed from the ReSharper</a> web site that outlines the highlights of Resharper v4. </p>
<p>If you have not grabbed the latest EAP bits, I suggest you give them a try. As a rule I only grab ones that are listed as tested successfully by JetBrains. Otherwise I avoid them :) I am now using <a href="http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/ReSharper/ReSharper+4.0+Nightly+Builds">EAP build 775</a> and have had not problems.</p>

    <p>Indiana Jones and I have one thing in common that is undisputable: we hate snakes. </p>
<p>This weekend I was cleaning my pool when I noticed a snake head sticking out of the small rock waterfall. It was hanging out inside of the hole where the water flows out. It was about an inch across but only about 2 inches of it were ever sticking out at any time so I could not tell how big or small it was.</p>
<p>I have no experience with snakes. Nor do I want to have any experience with them. I am not scared of snakes passing by, but when one is lodged in my pool area where my kids swim ... I had to do the "dad" thing and chase it away.</p>
<p>I tried several tactics to get it to come out. Everyone I called had ideas but nothing worked. I could not get pinchers into the area either. So I got my pressure washer and stood about 7 feet away from the waterfall holes, sprayed it into the holes and hoped the pressure would dislodge it and make it swim out and into the pool. It took about 5 minutes (felt like 30 minutes!) and it shot out of the hole from the pressure. It was 4 feet long! The thing swam crazy fast as it tried to get out of the pool. We tried to net it with the skimmer, but it just dove deep and went to the other side of the pool.</p>
<p>It jumped out a minute later and I used the pressure washer to chase him out of the pool area. It was in no hurry once outside in my backward so I tried to ensure that it would not return. When I approached it, it turned around before I could even get close and made a dash for me! Luckily I still had the pressure washer and thrust it back with the water. It ran off into the woods.</p>
<p>I learned later that is is either a black rat snake or a black racer snake. From the photos I have seen it is one or the other, though both are NOT venomous. I am on my way to the store today to purchase snake repellent. I will also be putting screens on my gutters to block any return visits.</p>
<p>Here is a photo of a black racer snake about the same size (4 foot length and 1 inch thick) as the one I found in my pool area.</p>

    <p>This past weekend I went online to check in for my flight on Sunday. I've used online check-ins for as long as they have been around. I have not been to a ticket counter in years. Yet for some reason I could not check in online this past weekend. So I call Orbitz and they tell me they know nothing and that I must call the airline directly to find out how to check in. So I call the airline and they tell me there are no problems with my reservation but I must check in at the airport. So I, being very very stupid in hindsight, believed them. I went to the Sarasota, FL airport on Sunday and they tell me I cannot check in because my my flights have been delayed and canceled. Um ... What!?!?!?!?!?!</p>
<p>There were no alternatives out of Sarasota to get to my destination that evening. I was furious when they told me that they knew this for hours yet did not post it on their web site nor tell me any of this when I called them a few hours ago! The best they could do was get me out the following day which would cause me to miss half the day at a .NET training class where I was the supposed to be training this week. </p>
<p>I found a flight out of Tampa, which is a 1 hour 15 minute drive from the Sarasota airport that was leaving in 1 hour and 20 minutes. I decided to try it. I got back in my car, drove up to Tampa, and of course a thunderstorm with the fury of Heaven poured down on me. It took me 1 hour and 25 minutes to get there, I figured it was too late. Then I saw that the flight was delayed by 15 minutes! I ran to the ticket counter to get my ticket ... 50 people were in line ahead of me! Somehow that line moved so fast I got my ticket (they actually let me buy it!). I ran up the escalator, to the shuttle, into security who gave this sweaty little Italian man some interesting looks, and to the gate as they were closing the doors. i was literally yelling for them to wait as they stepped into the doorway. It was crazy.</p>
<p>I made it. I made it.</p>

    <a href="/all/2008/04/08/next-up-orlando-devconnections.html">Next up, Orlando DevConnections!</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p><a href="http://www.devconnections.com/?refer=juliaL">DevConnections</a> in Orlando is just around the corner and I'll be there presenting 4 sessions on mobile development, the Entity Framework and SQL Server. So much has changed with these technologies in the past few months so I have all new code samples for new techniques using the latest bits, especially with the Entity Framework. if you are going to be at <a href="http://www.devconnections.com/?refer=juliaL">DevConnections</a> in April in Orlando, please stop by one of my sessions and say hi.</p>
<p>Here are the 4 session abstracts:</p>
<p><b>VMD302: Data Access Techniques and LINQ in Mobile Applications</b><br /><b><a href="http://www.johnpapa.net">John Papa</a></b><br />Data access layers, domain entities, and databases are all integral components of dealing with data in an enterprise application. Mobile applications also rely heavily on these types of data vehicles and stores. This session will delve into different ways of handling data in mobile applications using ADO.NET objects and domain entities. I will demonstrate different data binding techniques in mobile applications using both domain entities and DataSets as well as techniques using LINQ to interact with data on a mobile device. <blockquote> <p><b></b>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>VDA203: Getting Started with the Entity Framework</b><br /><b><a href="http://www.johnpapa.net">John Papa</a></b><br />The Entity Framework can be used to architect applications against a conceptual model that is mapped to the logic model. The Entity Framework has many components including EntityClient, Entity SQL, Object Services, the Entity Data Model, and LINQ to Entities. This session will discuss the architecture of the Entity Framework and explain the roles of each of its different components. It will also demonstrate how to write queries using the different options as well as how to evaluate which options within Object Services to use or if to use the EntityClient provider directly. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>VDA202: Customizing Entity Data Models in the Entity Framework</b><br /><b><a href="http://www.johnpapa.net">John Papa</a></b><br />Designing the Entity Data Model with the Entity Framework is a critical aspect in developing an architecture. Once the model has been created it is beneficial to know how to customize the model to adapt to the business problems. This session will explore the different XML files that map the objects to the database schema and show how to modify them when needed. I will explain how you can design an object model with the Entity Framework using both the Entity Data Model Wizard as well as&nbsp; by manually editing the XML files. I will demonstrate how to implement inheritance, how to merge multiple entities within&nbsp; a conceptual model, how to take advantage of features such as conditions in the mapping layer, how to implement complex types, and how to hook into stored procedures. This session will demonstrate how to interact with the conceptual model using EntityClient, Entity SQL, and LINQ to Entities to perform queries and make updates to a database.  <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="http://www.devconnections.com/?refer=juliaL"><img alt="DevConnections" src="http://www.johnpapa.net/images/fall07connexdata.png" border="0" /></a></p>
