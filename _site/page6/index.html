  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>If you watched my course <a href="http://jpapa.me/spangz" target="_blank">Build Apps with Angular and Breeze</a> the first week it was out and followed along by installing HotTowel, you may have hit an incompatibility with the recently released ASP.NET Web API 2 and Entity Framework 6. Good news! The exercise files, <a href="https://github.com/johnpapa/Pluralsight-CC-Angular-Breeze-Extra" target="_blank">github repo code samples</a>, and the NuGet packages for HotTowel.Angular and HotTowel.Angular.Breeze have all been updated to work with Breeze 1.4.5, Web API 2, and Entity Framework 6. So as you go through the course you can use the latest and greatest now. This course came out right when these new technologies went live, but it is all compatible now, so please enjoy the course and thanks for watching!</p>

<p>2 new videos clips for HotTowel installation have been provided to Pluralsight and are being uploaded. The new video shows all you need is:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
// install Sql Server Compact, for the database support
install-Package EntityFramework.SqlServerCompact

// Install HotTowel (angular, breeze, asp.net web api, etc)
Install-Package HotTowel.Angular.Breeze
</pre>

<p>You no longer need the <code>pre</code> as Angular 1.2.1 is now fully released.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: If you have older versions of EF, ASP.NET Web API 1, or EF &lt;= 5 then you may want to remove those first. There are compat issues when mixing those with the newer ones. If you simply try putting HotTowel on top of those, it likely won;t work. So clean it out first.</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/javascript/prototype/uncategorized/2013/11/12/protoctor.html">Setting the Prototype Constructor in JavaScript</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>While writing the upcoming Part 2 of <a href="http://jpapa.me/spangz" target="_blank">my Pluralsight course Building Apps with Angular and Breeze</a>, I found myself wanting to extend a constructor object with another constructor’s members. I had an object called <code>AbstractRepository</code> that has a set of functions (ex: <code>getAll</code>, <code>queryFailed</code>) that could be shared by many repositories. I had a <code>LookupRepository</code> with its own functions that are very specific to getting “lookups”. The way I settled on was to extend the <code>AbstractRepository</code>’s functions onto the <code>LookupRepository</code> by setting the prototype’s constructor. The result is that the <code>LookupRepository</code> gets all the functions that it has plus the <code>AbstractRepository</code>’s functions too.</p>

<blockquote>This technique is something <a href="http://twitter.com/wardbell" target="_blank">Ward Bell</a> and hashed out together during one of our code pairing sessions. It's great what you can achieve when you work together! We adapted this from some ideas from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8453887/why-is-it-necessary-to-set-the-prototype-constructor" target="_blank">this answer in StackOverflow</a>.</blockquote>

<p>First I create the constructor function for the <code>LookupRepository</code>.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
// LookupRepository
function Ctor(mgr) {
    this.repoName = 'repository.lookup';
    this.entityName = 'lookups';
    this.manager = mgr;
    // Exposed data access functions
    this.getAll = getAll;
    this.setLookups = setLookups;
}

AbstractRepository.extend(Ctor);

return Ctor;
</pre>

<p>The <code>AbstractRepository</code> was injected into <code>LookupRepository</code> (using <a href="http://angularjs.org" target="_blank">Angular</a>’s dependency injection). Notice I extend it by calling a method on the <code>AbstractRepository</code> and passing in the constructor function for the <code>LookupRepository</code>.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
AbstractRepository.extend(Ctor);
</pre>

<p>The <code>AbstractRepository</code>’s extend function set’s the prototype for the <code>LookupRepository</code> to the <code>AbstractRepository</code>’s constructor function. This extends the <code>AbstractRepository</code>’s  functions to the <code>LookupRepository</code>. Then we make sure the <code>LookupRepository</code> gets back its constructor function. So now the <code>LookupRepository</code> will have the functions from both repositories.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
// AbstractRepository
function Ctor() { }

Ctor.extend = function (repoCtor) {
    // Allow this repo to have access to 
    // the Abstract Repo's functions,
    // then put its own Ctor back on itself.
    repoCtor.prototype = new Ctor();
    repoCtor.prototype.constructor = repoCtor;
};
</pre>

<p>The <code>AbstractRepository</code>’s function are now accessible from the <code>LookupRepository</code>. So if the <code>AbstractRepository</code> has some generic functions like <code>_getAllLocal</code> which may get all of the data for a given resource, then <code>LookupRepository</code> can use it.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
// AbstractRepository
Ctor.prototype._getAllLocal = _getAllLocal;
Ctor.prototype._queryFailed = _queryFailed;
</pre>

<p>This adds value when you have a set of repositories such as <code>LookupRepository</code>, SessionRepository, SpeakerRepository, AttendeeRepository, and so on where they all can re-use the common functions from <code>AbstractRepository</code>.</p>

<p>I don’t need this technique often, but it does come in handy.</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/angular/bower/hottowel/nuget/pluralsight/uncategorized/2013/10/31/hot-towel-angular.html">Create an Angular App in Seconds with Hot Towel</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Looking for an easy way to kick-start your <a href="http://angularjs.org" target="_blank">Angular</a> app development in under a minute? Now you can with <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/hottowel.angular" target="_blank">HotTowel.Angular, a free NuGet package</a> (and soon to become a Bower package too). What do you get? Let’s take a look …</p>

<p><img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/HotTowel-NG-Preview-600x322.png" alt="HotTowel-NG-Preview" width="600" height="322" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-20961" /></p>

<h3>What's Inside?</h3>
<p>There are a few libraries out of the box that come with HotTowel.Angular. Of course Angular is in here, but there are a few others I bundled into this package as they work very well together and I find myself wanting them in most apps. They help add a bit of style, theming, and helpers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Angular core library</li>
<li>Angular's routing module</li>
<li>Angular's animation module</li>
<li>Twitter Bootstrap for layout</li>
<li>FontAwesome icons</li>
</ul>

<h3>Code Kick-Start</h3>
<p>Adding some libraries is a convenience, but one of the first things that helps me get going with an app is to get the basic structure laid out. So I included what I have found to be most helpful in kick-starting my apps. I think you’ll find that this code will help you get out of the gate quickly and you can customize it any way you like. Here is a glimpse of just some of what you will find. You can learn more about the <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/angular-growth-structure/" target="_blank">structure of the app by reading this post</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Responsive Design with Custom CSS</li>
<li>Dashboard Structure</li>
<li>Multiple Views and Menu Structure</li>
<li>Spinner</li>
<li>Logging</li>
<li>Splash Page</li>
<li>Alerts via <a href="http://toastrjs.com" target="_blank">Toastr</a></li>
<li>Structured Code</li>
</ul>

<h3>Easy Peasy</h3>
<p>It’s super simple to install HotTowel.Angular. Use the NuGet Package Manager Console and go!</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
Install-Package HotTowel.Angular
</pre>

<p>I hope you all enjoy HotTowel.Angular!</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/haswel/intel/uncategorized/2013/10/31/slim-trim-and-nimble-intel-haswell.html">Slim, Trim, and Nimble Intel Haswell</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I’ve been toting around my Intel Haswell Ultrabook for a few months now and the combination of slim, trim, fast, touch, and long battery life has mad eit my laptop of choice. I’ve had several review Ultrabooks (Intel has been gracious enough to send some my way) and they all had their pro’s and cons, but this one has really set itself apart for me. I was even asked by a few folks if it was a black Mac Air!</p>

<p><img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/haswell-trim.jpg" alt="haswell trim" width="600" height="165" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20991" /></p>

<p>It has not been all roses, however. This pre-production unit is my 3rd laptop from Intel. The first 2 had issues with the keyboard (keys fell off) and the fan (which ran like  helicopter). The folks at Intel were kind enough to fix these issues and since then I have been humming along and loving the device. To be fair, it’s mostly due to the light weight and long battery life. The idea is to review the Intel hardware such as the Haswell chip, so I’ll separate my experience with the Haswell chip from the pre-production prototype unit.</p>

<h2>Battery Life</h2>
<p>Haswell is awesome. I own about 8 laptops and tablets.  My favorite 2 are the Mac Air with Haswell and this Intel Haswell Ultrabook. They simply run fast, are easy to carry around, and I get anywhere from 8 to 11 hours of battery life out of them  with some pretty heavy coding use. The least battery life i have had with the Ultrabook is about 7 hours and that was with my coding, while watching a movie, while running some backgrounds services for games. Really quite impressive.</p>

<h2>Presentations</h2>
<p>I spend a lot of time presenting material at local, regional and global events. having a laptop where I do not have to plug-in for an entire day of work is just pure awesomeness! In fact, I often leave my cord in the hotel room when I travel and I leave it at home when i go to work. that’s an extra pound or so that I don’t have to carry around! You might think it is not a big deal, but when all you have is a sub 3 lb laptop, even forgo the laptop bag. It works great, is fast, and projects well, which is crucial, on both VGA and HDMI.</p>

<p>I’m now wondering what I am going to do with all of my non Haswell computers. Anyone in the market for some non Haswell laptops? :)</p>

    <a href="/uncategorized/2013/10/26/build-apps-with-angular-and-breeze.html">Build Apps with Angular and Breeze</a>

  <div>
    
    
    <p><img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/angular-icon.png" alt="angular-icon" width="96" height="96" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-21531" />You know how sometimes we start coding a simple app and you start sprinkling a few cool tiny features and suddenly you realize your app has blossomed into something special? Well, that’s how I feel about the app you will build in my latest course-series (yes, “series” is no typo) for <a href="http://pluralsight.com" target="_blank">Pluralsight</a> titled “<a href="http://jpapa.me/spangz" target="_blank">Building Apps with Angular and Breeze</a>”. I started out thinking I’d just help folks get up to speed on building simple Angular apps, but the app started to speak to me. It wanted to do more and when doing more the app needed some structure. Pretty soon patterns emerged as the story evolved.</p>

<p>So let’s talk about a cool Angular app, kick-starter NuGet packages, HotTowel, Breeze, and a new series of courses!</p>

<h3>Experiencing the Story</h3>
<p>Something I feel very strongly about was showing HOW the app evolved. It would be much easier for me to just show the app in its completed state and walk through the code. It would be a disservice though as you’d miss out on all of the decision points where I decided to refactor working code, why I refactored it, and what options I weighed, and how to refactor it. As we all know, that’s real world development. Of course, this meant the course took me much longer to complete than if I just walked through it (which is a fine teaching tool, but just not the one i wanted to choose here).  The net result is what I believe is a valuable experience where you get to join me for a story of how to build a web app with Angular, Breeze, and JavaScript patterns.</p>

<blockquote>I would be remiss if I did not call out Ward Bell (<a href="http://breezejs.com" target="_blank">Breeze.js</a> master) who once again has provided a ton of input on this course and the app. In fact, several Breeze features came out of this course (ex: a validation directive). Thanks Ward for both your technical input and being a tremendous friend!
</blockquote>

<h3>The Story Continues</h3>
<p>The added benefit of this is that I was able to craft a follow-up story quickly to this first course. The story will continue very soon in another course (Part 2 if you will in this course-series) where I expand on some more advanced topics including how to manage your app once you have a significant amount of real-world data interaction, saving and rehydrating from local storage, powerful data validation, and some surprises with some wicked cool ways to handle saving. :) The course is targeted to be out by Dec 31. And who knows … perhaps if these are received well, i’ll keep going :)</p>

<h3>What's Covered?</h3>
<p>So what’s in this course? Well, the description in a nutshell is that you will build a Single Page Application (SPA) from scratch using JavaScript, Angular, and Breeze. You will learn how to combine the Angular presentation framework, rich data features of Breeze, and raw features of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML5 to create robust modern web applications. There is a live demo so you can see what you are building, some starter code, step by step instructions, and some new NuGet packages to get you started (more on those later in this article).</p>

<p>The chapters/modules are below. I truly hope you enjoy this course as much as I enjoyed producing it!</p>

<ul>
<li>Building an App with Angular, Breeze and JavaScript Patterns</li>
<li>Getting Started with Single Page Apps</li>	
<li>Angular from Scratch with HotTowel</li>	
<li>Creating Vertical Slice Through Your App</li>	
<li>Object Graphs, Extending Models, and Custom Directives</li>	
<li>Sharing Local and Remote Data Across Views</li>	
<li>Route Resolvers</li>
<li>Filtering</li>
<li>Paging, UI-Bootstrap, and Expanding the Data Service with Queries</li>
<li>Building a Dashboard</li>	
<li>Animations with Angular and CSS</li>
<li>Where Are We and a Look Ahead at What's Next</li>
</ul>

<h3>HotTowel Angular on NuGet</h3>
<p>Sometimes you just want a kick-start … or if you are like me, a kick in the pants to get your project off the “blank canvas”. if that’s you, then <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/HotTowel.Angular/2.0.0-rc3" target="_blank">HotTowel.Angular</a> is perfect for you. It uses some styling, some popular libraries, and of course Angular to get you off to a nice starting point. When its time to pull in Breeze, just ad in <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/HotTowel.Angular.Breeze/2.0.0-rc3" target="_blank">HotTowel.Angular.Breeze</a>.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
Install-Package HotTowel.Angular -pre
Install-Package HotTowel.Angular.Breeze -pre
</pre>

<p>Notice that these are both pre-releases. That’s because they depend on the package AngularJs.Core which is a package that uses the pre-release of Angular 1.2.0 RC3 (currently the latest). Once Angular goes live (which i hear is very soon) these packages will all no longer need the <code>-pre</code> option.</p>

<p>What’s AngularJs.Core? This package makes it easy to grab just the core module for Angular. Angular 1.2.x begins a new era with Angular where each module is broken out into its own files. This means you don’t need to load code you are not using. but it also means you don;t have to pull down a bunch of files into your project that you won;t be using either. So the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/AngularJS.Core" target="_blank">AngularJS.Core package</a> pulls just the core module. There are also a series of other packages for the Angular modules that I created and maintain with Scott Allen and Jeremy Likness. <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/modular-angularjs-nuget-packages/" target="_blank">You can find all of these packages on NuGet or in this article here</a>.</p>

    <a href="/javascript/mac/sublime/uncategorized/2013/10/18/browsing-to-a-simple-web-server-on-a-mac-from-sublime-text.html">Browsing to a Simple Web Server on a Mac from Sublime Text</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p><img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/sublime.jpg" alt="sublime" width="160" height="160" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-21981" />Lately one of the computers I have been using is a Mac Air with the Haswell chip. The combination of the Mac Air’s sleek and lightweight design along with the super long life and power of the Haswell chip is just fantastic!  I’m using both OSX and Windows (in Parallels) and I spend most of my time on the Air in Xcode, <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a>, and Visual Studio (also tinkering with <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/objc/" target="_blank">AppCode from Jet Brains</a> … but more on that later).</p>

<p>When I want to write and test some quick HTML/JavaScript/CSS that requires a web server on the Mac Air I use Sublime Text. Sublime is pretty cool as an editor and the plug-in ecosystem is reach. But many of the plug-ins lack polish, some don’t seem to work well, and it can be daunting to know which one to choose at times. Overall I love the plug in model, but its very similar to Visual Studio’s in that you need to try them out to know which you like. So why did I go down this road? Well, when writing and testing some SPA code I often want to run it in the context of a web server. Simple HTML/JS is fine off the file system, but somethings require a bit more. For example, to avoid getting Cross Origin request errors when using <a href="http://angularjs.org" target="_blank">AngularJS</a> and routing for templates.</p>

<p>I found a quick and easy way to solve this with some built in OS features on the Mac.</p>

<h3>Browsing from Sublime</h3>
<p>I wanted to browse HTML code without a web server on a Mac. So i could simply right click the HTML file in Sublime and open it in the browser and have it point to localhost on a specified port (and not <code>file://</code>)</p>

<p>Why? If you open a HTML file in the browser from Sublime it may run, but it also may produce an error about cross origin request if your code has any of that (like with routing of templates). This is because you may be serving everything off the file system and not a web server.</p>

<h3>Quick Solution</h3>
<p>Run the SimpleHTTPServer on the Mac using the Terminal, for the folder where your code lives.</p>

<ul><li><code>CMD + SPACE</code> (open Spotlight)</li>
<li>Type <code>Terminal</code> and hit <code>ENTER</code></li>
<li>Navigate to your development folder.</li> 
<li>Type <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000</code></li>
<li>Right click in Sublime and Open in Browser</li>
</ul>

<p>This should browse to your code at <code>http://localhost:8000/SublimeTest/index.html</code></p>

<p>I made some assumptions here. For example, when you navigate to your development folder, I put all my demos under the same folder to make life easy. My folder is called <code>develop</code>, so this is where I set up the server.</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/breeze/javascript/pluralsight/spa/uncategorized/2013/10/15/learn-breeze.html">Learn Breeze</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>It is no secret that I am a huge fan of <a href="http://breezejs.com" target="_blank">Breeze </a>as I use it as a core component in my web applications and I use them extensively in my SPA courses. And now the first in depth training on Breeze has hit <a href="http://pluralsight.com" target="_blank">Pluralsight</a>. My friend Brian Noyes recently published his <a href="http://jpapa.me/noyesbreeze" target="_blank">Building Data-Centric Single Page Apps with Breeze</a> course and it truly is tremendous!</p>

<p>Brian’s course covers the full gamut of what Breeze can do for you, such as formulating rich queries on the client side (filtering, sorting, and paging) that get executed on the server side, saving changes in batches, and validating changes on the client side. In modules 7 &amp; 8 Brian dives into validation and shows how Breeze can automatically create some client validation rules for things like type checking, required fields and string length. He then shows how you can use other built in client validation rules such as phone, email, and regular expression checking as well as creating custom validation rules. The course covers Breeze, which works with Knockout/Durandal and Angular. Brian uses Knockout, but the Breeze concepts and syntax is all the same either way you want to go.</p>

<h3>Validation</h3>
<p>The following code snippet shows how you can hook up built-in validation rules as your Breeze EntityManager is initialized when your main page/app loads:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
var app = app || {};

function initValidation(em) {
    // Add phone validation rule 
    var store = em.metadataStore;
    var userType = store.getEntityType("User");
    var phoneProp = userType.getProperty("phone");
    phoneProp.validators.push(breeze.Validator.phone());

    // Add email, credit card, and URL validators
    userType.getProperty("email").validators.push(breeze.Validator.email());
    userType.getProperty("creditCard").validators.push(breeze.Validator.creditCard());
    userType.getProperty("webSite").validators.push(breeze.Validator.url());

    var userKeyValidator = breeze.Validator.makeRegExpValidator(
        "userKeyVal", 
        /^[A-Za-z0-9]{8}-[A-Za-z0-9]{4}-[A-Za-z0-9]{4}-[A-Za-z0-9]{4}-[A-Za-z0-9]{12}$/, 
        "%displayName% '%value%' is not a valid GUID");

    userType.getProperty("userKey").validators.push(userKeyValidator);

};

app.em = new breeze.EntityManager("breeze/ValDemo");

app.em.fetchMetadata().then(function () { initValidation(app.em); });
</pre>

<p>Here you can see the demo app running with a validation error <a href="http://toastrjs.com" target="_blank">toastr</a> alert highlighting the error. By using the manual validation invocation that is demonstrated in module 8, you can block dismissing the dialog if there are any validation errors. You can also do async server calls to execute server validation rules, get back the errors and act on them or display them on the client side, all also discussed and demonstrated in the validation modules.

<p>This year (2013) I will be releasing a course that shows how to use many of these concepts in a powerful SPA built with Angular and Breeze. So I recommend watching Brian’s course in preparation for my upcoming one!</p>

    <p>If you want to learn how to build a SPA with <a href="http://angularjs.org" target="_blank">Angular</a> with me (<a href="https://www.anglebrackets.org/register.aspx" target="_blank">and get an Xbox One</a>), register for my <a href="http://anglebrackets.org/workshops.aspx" target="_blank">SPA workshop at AngleBrackets and DEVIntersection</a> and <strong>use code PAPA to get $50 off</strong> the conference registration! I hear workshop attendees can get an Xbox One too just for registering for a workshop!</p>

<p>We’ll cover syntax, but we’ll focus on how to ask the right questions and what choices are important to make as we demonstrate the techniques. <a href="https://twitter.com/wardbell" target="_blank">Ward Bell</a> (1 brilliant mind behind <a href="http://breezejs.com" target="_blank">Breeze</a>) will be guest starring and frankly there isn’t a data or business problem on Earth that he can’t solve (or at least I haven’t stumped him yet). So please join us for what should be an awesome day of SPA with Angular, Breeze, and real-world patterns for building web applications.
<img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10-5-2013-11-41-40-AM.png" alt="10-5-2013 11-41-40 AM" width="600" height="398" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21801" /></p>

<p>Here is some of what we’ll be covering, either in discussion or demos:</p>

<h4>What Do You Need in a SPA?</h4>
<p>Measure twice, cut once. That’s great advice and it certainly applies to building software. I’m all about starting quickly so we can see progress and realign quickly. But first, we need to make sure we know what we are solving and what the right choices are. So it all starts with a conversation about SPA, the libraries, pros and cons, and how to get started. This part is fun and light and really helps break the ice early in the morning.</p>

<h4>Bootstrapping and Patterns</h4>
<p>Once you start on a path, you need to get off the blank canvas and write some code. We’ll do exactly that, and get you started on the right foot with some popular development patterns.</p>

<h4>Routing</h4>
<p>Hugely important topic that will get some serious love. Multi pages, routing, page life cycle, layout, parameters, Angular services … phew! The importance of a good router can not be overstated.</p>

<h4>Data and Repository Pattern</h4>
<p>As your app grows, so do your data needs. Don’t let it get out of control. We’ll talk CRUD, what’s a datacontext, how Angular factories/services can help, $resource, $http, jQuery, and breeze to help pick your medicine. We may even show some advanced techniques!</p>

<h4>Saving Data and Validation</h4>
<p>Data is at the heart of most apps. So how do we combine data with compelling application scenarios? We’ll do exactly that with CSS, Breeze, Angular and Local Storage.</p>

<h4>SPA Frameworks</h4>
<p>There are many SPA Presentation Frameworks, so we’ll talk a little about the cream of the crop and even show some apps built using them to see some differences. We’ll circle back to Angular as a compare and contrast to show some options, too.</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/productivity/uncategorized/work/2013/10/02/enjoy-more-productive-and-less-meetings.html">Enjoy More Productive and Less Meetings</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Does your calendar resemble a Tetris board? Do you spend more time in meetings talking about what you are going to do than the time that you spend actually doing it? You’re not alone.</p>

<p>There are some simple ways to reduce the time you spend in meetings and make them more productive. I’ve changed the way I look at meetings it has really helped relieve my time so I can spend more time getting things done.</p>

<p>So what destroys meeting time? Here are a few common issues that need to be squashed:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Comfy Pillow</li>
<li>The 5 Year Old Soccer Game</li>
<li>The Derailer</li>
<li>The Mind-Eraser</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Comfy Pillow</h2>
<p>When teams get overly comfortable, the meetings can go on and on to the point where the purpose gradually deviates so far from where you started that nobody knows why you are meeting anymore. Often these meetings run over the time limit too. Why does this happen? This is due to the comfy pillow effect, which happens when everyone gets so comfortable in their chairs they can just sit back and pontificate. The solution: remove the comfy pillow.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/dsc_0031-560.jpg" alt="dsc_0031-560" width="300" height="238" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-21731" />Stand-ups are a simple way to be more productive. The idea is simple: short meetings with no chairs. Each person reviews their status and any blocking issues. I find these are most often useful when they are done in an uncomfortable area. A conference room built for this is ideal, where you have whiteboards at most … no chairs at all. Tables are optional, but I prefer none. I find that teams do well with this once they get the idea that it has to stay on point and everyone gets their say.</p>

<h2>The Derailer</h2>
<p>You can’t have a person derailing the entire meeting. Well, you can … but I really prefer not to.</p>

<p>You can do everything right. Stay on point, have a purpose, be clear about what the result of the meeting should be … but then the Derailer steps in. All good intentions can go astray when the Derailer makes his/her presence known. The Derailer has good intentions too and often sways people in the meeting to follow their tangent because it sounds important and compelling. In fact the Derailer may have a compelling point. But by deviating from the purpose and raising an entirely new path to follow, what often happens is neither the original purpose of the meeting nor the new topic from the Derailer are resolved.</p>

<p>Your time is precious and it becomes too difficult to solve many problems at once. Kindly remind the Derailer that while this is a great point for discussion that we will schedule a follow-up meeting to discuss it and take action. Today’s topic is to discuss and solve your current issue. Be kind. Be respectful. But act immediately and decisively.</p>

<h2>The 5 Year Old Soccer Game</h2>
<p>When I coached my daughters’ 5 year old soccer games I sat in awe at how every kid on the field swarmed to the ball. It was so cute! They all wanted their time with the ball and left their positions to be around it. Even the goal-tenders abandoned the goals. it certainly isn’t very effective, but the kids do love being close to each other and the ball. It’s fun!</p>

<p><img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Soccer-10.jpg" alt="Soccer-10" width="225" height="215" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-21711" />People arrive at a meeting with an idea of what they want to get out of it. This is their position. When a tangent idea in a meeting is tossed up, it can produce other random off-shoots. Others in the meeting continue to take it off course  until eventually it gets so far from the point that everyone leaves their positions to swarm the ball. So how do you prevent or stop this?</p>

<p>Have a clearly laid out focus for the meeting. Write in on a board in the room. Say it. Multiple times. Make it sink in. When things go off course, circle back to it and remind folks to get back to their positions before someone scores on the open goal.</p>

<h2>The Mind Eraser</h2>
<p>Ever walk out of a meeting and wonder what just happened? I have. An hour goes by and everyone walks out not knowing what action items they should work on, not knowing who is doing what, and wondering what happened to their day. It’s a deflating feeling to lose an hour of your life and not knowing what happened. It’s like having that hour simply erased.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.johnpapa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MIB-mind-eraser.jpg" alt="MIB-mind-eraser" width="400" height="309" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21681" /></p>

<p>You can avoid the Mind-Eraser meeting pretty simply by having an agenda. No, not just an agenda, but a clear-cut, simple, and well communicated agenda. Include in the meeting invite the agenda, whatever preparations are required, and what the result of them meeting will be.</p>

<blockquote>The purpose of this meeting is to determine if we want orange or purple databases. Please come prepared to present your case with pros and cons and your recommended course of action. We will leave with a decision and clear action items assigned to those who will be tasked to paint the database purple or orange.
</blockquote>

<p>If you do this, everyone is on the same page and the Mind-Eraser meetings won’t occur.</p>

<h2>What's the Point?</h2>
<p>So what do I do? When I receive a meeting invite, I check the agenda and look for “The Point”. If its clear, I go. If it’s not, I ask what the agenda is. What is it that we are resolving at this meeting? What do you expect to get out of it? Are the right people invited? What do I need to prepare for before going to this meeting? If the meeting agenda is blank and the subject line “Meeting”, I ask those questions. if I don’t get answers, I decline the meeting.</p>

<p>Is that bold? Yeah, I guess so. But I’ve never been told “because” or “just be there”. Not once. Why? I think people respect the inquiry as a sign that you want to help them and to do that you need some simple information. This must be done in a respectful and timely manner, and when done well, it has amazing results. Some meetings are canceled. Some are resolved in a simple 2 sentence email. And some meetings are clarified.</p>

<p>This has been the single most effective way I’ve been able to reduce, shorten, and clarify my meeting times. It’s amazing how quickly people hitch a ride on this train. Everyone wants to stay productive and if they call a meeting, they want you to come prepared.</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/javascript/uncategorized/2013/09/23/all-you-need-is-javascript.html">All You Need is JavaScript</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Is all you need JavaScript? Will writing everything yourself without helper libraries relieve the stress and get you an equally if not better solution? You may be shocked to learn that it might. And at the same time, it might not. So how do you know what to do?</p>

<p>Recently I wrote about <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/javascript-soup/" target="_blank">JavaScript Soup</a>: the phrase I like to use to refer to the plethora of JavaScript libraries and frameworks that have infiltrated our daily development lives. Is turning away from libraries and writing all the code yourself in JavaScript the answer?<img src="http://piwindowonbusiness.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/chocolates-forrest-gump-1814922-397-264.jpg" width="397" height="264" class="alignright" /></p>

<h2>Vanilla.js</h2>
<p>First let’s explore the attraction to Vanilla.js. <a href="https://twitter.com/shanselman" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman</a> pointed me to <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/" target="_blank">Vanilla.js</a>, a clever site that sheds light on the fact that you could really get all you want with plain old vanilla flavored JavaScript. The reason it’s so clever is that it’s so true! There is a lot we can do with JavaScript.</p>

<p>Let’s consider <a href="http://angularjs.org" target="_blank">AngularJS</a>, a super powerful presentation framework. Does it do anything you could not do with JavaScript? Nope. It is JavaScript. How about <a href="http://breezejs.com" target="_blank">Breeze.js</a>? Again, all JavaScript. So the argument could be made that if it’s just JavaScript, why not just write it yourself. After all, you could probably do what you need in fewer lines of code, right? If you write it yourself then you won’t have to learn Angular or any other library/framework! So this is always the best answer, right? Maybe.</p>

<blockquote>If you do write an awesome bit of JavaScript code, take the next step and share it via Open Source it! If you found value, maybe someone else will too.</blockquote>

<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
<p>There is no panacea to web development. If we choose VanillaJS we have complete control and likely a smaller code base overall, but is it as maintainable? If we choose to use popular and stable libraries we get a lot out of the box to jump-start us and help us long-term with maintenance, but at what cost?</p>

<p>The VanillaJS is appealing as you know exactly what you are getting. There is no box of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJh59vZ8ccc" target="_blank">chocolates here Forrest</a>! You want to interact with the DOM, go for it. You want AJAX or promises, code them yourself. No jQuery and no other libraries.</p>

<p>In some ways it’s entirely empowering. When writing VanillaJS you learn more about the core of JavaScript and can really raise your expertise. The power can be intoxicating! In fact I highly recommend you give it a try if you have not. I’ve gone here and through that experience I learned quite a bit.</p>

<p>The downside of VanillaJS is that you may be reinventing the wheel at times. You could spend a week (or even a day) writing code that already exists in a stable library. Is that bad? Not necessarily, but you need to decide the value for your time spent writing your code and then the long-term up-keep of it. Do you want to be writing cross browser code, test it in all environments, and keep it updated when something already exists? It might be more performant (yeah I know that’s not a real word, but it sounds cool).</p>

<p>The other side is choosing a library that handles it for you. If you choose a stable library you can save those hours or days (or weeks) of coding and gain a lot of maintainability. But Are you using the library for 1% of its features and thus carrying a ton of baggage with you for features you are not using? That baggage could be in latent bugs or simply in the size of the library (think performance). You definitely need to consider this as you don’t want a massive footprint in memory and size if you are not using 90%+ of it.</p>

<h2>What Do We Do?</h2>
<p>The picture gets a bit cloudy if you see this as an “either or” situation. But if instead of thrashing one side or the other as a global solution you consider when and where it makes sense to use each, the picture becomes much clearer.</p>

<p>You don’t have to choose 1 or the other. Often a mixture is a good path to follow. Rarely in life do we have cut and dry decisions, and this is no exception. In my JavaScript Soup post I mention some guidelines I try to follow for choosing a library. These still apply here. If the library offers you an advantage based on that checklist and you will be using a considerable amount if its features, then feel good about using it.</p>

<p>It’s all about value. If you find value in it and can live with the costs, then go for it. This applies to both libraries and VanillaJS. Don’t kid yourself, they both have costs. What we get paid to do is decide how to balance those costs with the project and company needs.</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with using a stable library. If you can add value to your project by integrating that with some of your own VanillaJS, then go for it. That’s even better!  I recommend striking a good balance between the two.</p>
